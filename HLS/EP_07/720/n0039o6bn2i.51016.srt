1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,680
What's the point of
having the best results of finalist season?

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,590
We still didn't even go to the finals

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:05,960
because of someone...

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,870
And finally gave
the trophy to the opponent.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,640
Who actually led to

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,910
Ming's severe hand injury?

7
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,670
Not all mistakes

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:18,070
can be covered by time.

9
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,920
Lu Yue will definitely
not be the starting player.

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,830
Anyway, this must have been

11
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,280
done by someone among us.

12
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,600
I posted the video.

13
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,120
Chubby?

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,000
Why did you have the fight?

15
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,880
Why did you get Ming involved in?

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,350
Why did you drag the whole team down?

17
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,880
You're just a coward
who runs away all the time!

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,430
What did you say?!

19
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,240
I'll say it as many times as I please!

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:38,840
You are a coward!

21
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,560
Chubby, stop it!

22
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,070
Shut up! I dare you to say it again!

23
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:41,840
You're just a coward.

24
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,350
- That's enough, Chubby.
- Let's go.

25
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,200
Let's go. Go out and calm down.

26
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,600
Chubby, you made a mistake.

27
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,030
Lu Yue didn't fight
with others for no reason.

28
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,790
Obviously, it was Lu Yue's fault.

29
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,710
Why are you guys trying to
cover for him all the time?

30
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,280
The truth is often more than meets the eye.

31
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,200
Do you want to hear about it?

32
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,640
What exactly happened a year ago?

33
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,420
=Falling into Your Smile=

34
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,180
=Episode 08=

35
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,400
Hey, Yao, I know that...

36
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,120
Don't hang up, Yao!

37
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,150
Go watch Ai Jia's live streaming.

38
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,800
He's trying to help Lu Yue clarify online.

39
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,710
It's a coincidence.

40
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,000
I was having a diarrhea
in the toilet at the time.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,960
(The JK people were indeed distasteful.)

42
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,840
(It takes two to make a quarrel.)
You have no idea

43
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,190
(Lu Yue deserves to be banned for a year.)
what a pain in the ass the JK people were.

44
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,080
(What kind of rubbish is ZGDX?)

45
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,280
(Look at their cocky faces.)

46
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,910
They're too arrogant.

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,870
That's right.

48
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,520
Especially Lu Yue.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,710
His brother didn't show up
at tonight's cocktail party, either.

50
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,280
And he dared to mess around.

51
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,680
(Didn't even show some respect to our A.)

52
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,240
(A spent the money,)

53
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,080
so much money

54
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,800
just for a promotion before the game.

55
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:46,910
(Now guess what?)

56
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,080
(It went live)

57
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,680
and we ended with a 2:0.)

58
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,910
Didn't we have a deal?

59
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,000
It's a performance game,

60
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,750
and just make it 2:1 and call it a game.

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,520
Okay, forget about the score,

62
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,310
but what's up with their cocky attitude?

63
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,190
They're really asking for a beating.

64
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,120
Also,

65
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,840
if A were in a better state today,

66
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,000
they'd have had no chance at winning.

67
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,960
That's right.

68
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,150
(So what if they can get to the finals?)

69
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,630
(They're too arrogant.)

70
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,430
(I know.)

71
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,910
They want to get in the national finals?

72
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,710
Stop dreaming.

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,280
No respect for me,

74
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,590
then I'll show them

75
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,590
what it means to have no mercy.

76
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,520
Hello?

77
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,840
(Get over here in a while.)

78
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,520
(Yep.)

79
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,870
Bring more people

80
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,910
and rip the hands

81
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,190
off of those little bastards

82
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,520
of ZGDX.

83
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,840
By the way,

84
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,470
be careful when you do it.

85
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,630
Don't hurt the second son of the Lu family.

86
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,840
Wait, A,

87
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,280
(why isn't Lu Yue included?)

88
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,000
(He's from the Lu Family.)

89
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,150
(It'll cause a lot of trouble.)

90
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,430
This fight

91
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,280
was purely initiated by A.

92
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,120
He said himself that

93
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,120
he'd find people

94
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,400
to break the hands of
those professional players.

95
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,400
Who are those professional players?

96
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,400
The ZGDX players.

97
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,120
Bros.

98
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,910
They were looking for people

99
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:11,000
to break the hands of ZGDX players,

100
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,630
and they weren't joking.

101
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,960
They actually made the phone call.

102
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,630
(If it were you,)

103
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,040
(wouldn't you step up)

104
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,630
(in a situation like this?)

105
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,240
(If the people they asked for
really came over,)

106
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,000
(then it'd have been too late.)

107
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,800
(So, this is how the whole thing happened.)

108
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,560
(I only tell you the truth,)

109
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,800
(and I don't judge.)

110
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,870
Think about it.

111
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,000
Bye-bye.

112
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,120
Lu Yue.

113
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,920
Since we're all in the same team,

114
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,270
you shouldn't have hidden the fact

115
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,950
that you fought to protect us to begin with.

116
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,310
They were right about one thing.

117
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,430
Your hand got injured

118
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,000
because of my fight.

119
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,830
Lu Yue.

120
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,070
All right.

121
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,680
Now that everything's clear,

122
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,800
nobody should hold on to the past.

123
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,390
But I'm still partly responsible

124
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,430
for your hand injury.

125
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,270
So even if I confess it,

126
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,680
it wouldn't change anything.

127
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,720
Chubby is right.

128
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,720
I did drag you down,

129
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,750
and the team as well.

130
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,830
Anyway,

131
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,950
it's true that Lu Yue was too impulsive.

132
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,430
But it's not

133
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,480
entirely

134
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,750
Lu Yue's fault.

135
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,950
After all,

136
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,800
A from JK was too mean.

137
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,830
Yeah, if it were me,

138
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,630
who heard that someone
was going to beat up my bros,

139
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,920
I'd get into the fight as well.

140
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,800
Am I right?

141
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,560
So we can't blame everything

142
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,480
on Lu Yue.

143
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,160
You guys shouldn't think this way.

144
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,950
You should go to the police instead.

145
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,510
That's right.

146
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,240
Sue him and get him to beg for forgiveness.

147
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,720
Now that we all know the truth,

148
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,950
K,

149
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,920
Chubby,

150
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,270
are you guys

151
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,750
fine now?

152
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,480
Lu Yue.

153
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,950
I am sorry.

154
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,630
It's my bad.

155
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,430
I was wrong about you.

156
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,270
It's okay.

157
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,870
Cheng,

158
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,920
I think we should

159
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,750
make the truth public first.

160
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,270
It might not change
the public opinion completely,

161
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,560
but at least we should let people know

162
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,190
that we didn't start the fight.

163
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,310
I'll call the PR department

164
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,390
to see how it should proceed.

165
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,430
Lu Yue,

166
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,000
sorry.

167
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,000
I don't feel wronged.

168
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,680
I did make

169
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,510
the worst decision.

170
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,190
Lu Yue,

171
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,120
when you encounter something like this,

172
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,000
you should call me as soon as possible.

173
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,390
If I were there,

174
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,870
Ming's hand would have been fine.

175
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,870
If you had called me,

176
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,800
I could've…

177
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,870
called the police,

178
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,720
right?

179
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,070
Okay, forget it.

180
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,480
(Cheng is here! Cheng is here!)

181
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,430
(I finally get to see people
from ZGDX live streaming.)

182
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,040
(Curiosity kills me.)

183
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,040
(Can Cheng explain the fight?)

184
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,630
(Why did Lu Yue start the fight?)

185
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,310
It was indeed Lu Yue
who made the first move.

186
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,600
As for why,

187
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,240
you can go watch Ai Jia's live streaming.

188
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,320
(Ming's hand got injured,
and you guys quit the final.)

189
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,550
(That's why you fought, right?)

190
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,510
(3-second silence tribute for Ming.)

191
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:40,150
Ming's hand got injured due to an accident.

192
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,240
Truly,

193
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,000
it's related to this,

194
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,200
but Ming had injured his hand before as well.

195
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,910
This is common among professional players.

196
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,270
A tendon tear.

197
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,840
It's normal for those
who play in a core position.

198
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,000
(No matter what, Lu Yue was too impulsive.)

199
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,080
(Cheng,)

200
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,870
(if it were you,)

201
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,000
(what would you have done?)

202
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,270
I won't beat them up.

203
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,150
But I will let those

204
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,720
who bully my teammates know

205
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,270
what it means to regret.

206
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:09,910
(ZGDX contract renewal)
Look.

207
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,790
This is my contract renewal with the club.

208
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,630
Why don't you take your time
to practice more

209
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,240
shikigamis instead of showing off?

210
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,790
Is it time to give me a regular spot, right?

211
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,960
I can't always fight with this fool
for the computer all day,

212
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,790
right? Ming.

213
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
That should tell you

214
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,600
who's the more crucial one.

215
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,030
I'm talking about
adding a computer desk for you.

216
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:42,150
Chubby has been busy
in the kitchen since this morning.

217
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,030
I think it's going to be something big.

218
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:43,750
What's he doing?

219
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,790
I'm guessing

220
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,910
he's trying to make up to everyone

221
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,120
by making a dinner.

222
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,720
Chubby,

223
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,000
I didn't know you were good at this.

224
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,320
I've been in the team for so long,

225
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,720
but this is the first time I've seen this.

226
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,840
What do you want? I'll get it for you.

227
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,510
No, I'm fine.

228
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,750
You guys just take your seats.

229
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,840
Rui,

230
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,150
I heard that Chubby was fined
three months of his salary this time.

231
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,270
Really?

232
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,320
This means anytime he might ask me
to lend him some money

233
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,030
within these three months.

234
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,550
Can I choose not to eat
this miserable meal?

235
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,120
I won't eat it either.

236
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,960
Stop the sarcasm,

237
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,960
or else both of you will be fined.

238
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,390
OK, I'll eat it.

239
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,750
I deserve it.

240
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,600
I deserve all of it.

241
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,120
Chubby,

242
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,150
even though you got fined,

243
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,390
shouldn't you at least
get another pound of meat

244
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,600
to treat us?

245
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,080
There's nothing here.

246
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,510
Yeah, not even
a single piece of meat in there.

247
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,670
Hand it to me if you guys
don't want to eat it.

248
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,320
No, no.

249
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,200
I'll eat it.

250
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,440
Let me dig deeper.

251
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,150
Do you want mine?

252
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,240
Do you have meat?

253
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,200
A little.

254
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,240
What are you doing?

255
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,600
What the... Chubby.

256
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,000
I thought the act of

257
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,390
hiding meat in the bowl

258
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,030
for your favorite child

259
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,630
has been long gone since my mother's time.

260
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,960
I…

261
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,630
See,

262
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,360
he's mad now.

263
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,080
Lu Yue, I was wrong.

264
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,270
I shouldn't have led the negative
public opinion against you

265
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,480
before seeing the whole picture.

266
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,320
I'm sorry.

267
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,390
Sooner or later,
this door will collapse because of Chubby.

268
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:11,910
Great.

269
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,510
Now get serious.

270
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,630
So everyone's okay with Lu Yue

271
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,630
returning to the team this time, right?

272
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,270
Yes.

273
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,550
Then I'll submit the roster
for the new season tomorrow.

274
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,390
Wait, what?

275
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,870
What do you mean by everyone?

276
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,720
Why is everyone okay with it?

277
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,720
How about me?

278
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,550
I'm not okay with that.

279
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:29,270
All new members
must start from the bench.

280
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,200
Really?

281
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,720
I've never played professionally,
don't lie to me.

282
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,790
Lu Yue is right.

283
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,150
Back in the days
when Cheng started to play professionally,

284
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,440
he was also a substitute.

285
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,790
It only took him a year

286
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,550
to make the player shiver

287
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,790
and make him the substitute.

288
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,150
Correction.

289
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,320
He didn't make him shiver.

290
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,960
It's impossible

291
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,320
to make me shiver.

292
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,750
Shut up.

293
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,910
Who on earth was the person

294
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,790
that made the other shiver?

295
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,670
Hierophant.

296
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,150
Hierophant?

297
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:02,600
From TAT?

298
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,630
My brother and Hierophant

299
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,080
used to be each other's greatest substitute.

300
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,080
The strongest light and shadow
in OCK history.

301
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,000
Eat.

302
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,510
Are you trying to persuade me or what?

303
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,910
I'm trying to tell you

304
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,320
that gold will glitter no matter where it is.

305
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,960
Look at Cheng and Hierophant,

306
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,630
right?

307
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:20,870
They're both well respected.

308
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,270
One person rules one division.

309
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,910
All other attack players

310
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,080
will shiver

311
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,790
under the claws

312
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,840
of these two people.

313
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,870
The shadow that almost crumbled
after getting defeated by Tai for once,

314
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,510
I loathe her.

315
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:34,960
Don't be rude.

316
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,910
Repeat it.

317
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,080
Nope.

318
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,750
He won't repeat, then you do.

319
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,480
What?

320
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,630
Your brother is about to bully me.

321
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,200
First come first serve.

322
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,600
You came back too late,

323
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,910
and she's good at more shikigamis

324
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,200
than you.

325
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,390
Behave yourself.

326
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,240
Why are you standing by her?

327
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,200
None of your business.

328
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,600
Did you hear it? Did you?

329
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,030
First come first serve.

330
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,030
I'm good at more shikigamis

331
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,630
than you.

332
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,510
You should behave, too.

333
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,480
The two of you

334
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,150
have never participated
in an official competition before.

335
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:07,720
To play safe,

336
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,480
isn't it normal to have a substitute?

337
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,840
If you guys want to be part of the lineups,

338
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,150
then get it with your skills.

339
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,390
Good. Great.

340
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,600
I really respect
Cheng's suggestion this time.

341
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,360
Anyway,

342
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,030
this is the fairest treatment

343
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,270
I've seen.

344
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,120
Really.

345
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,480
(One, two, three, four.)

346
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,550
(Five, six, seven, eight.)

347
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:10,590
(Two, two, three, four.)

348
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,680
(Five, six, seven, eight.)

349
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:18,750
(Three, two, three, four.)

350
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:22,830
(Five, six, seven, eight.)

351
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,350
(Four, two, three, four.)

352
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,200
(Five, six, seven, eight.)

353
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,830
(Five, two...)

354
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,720
Cheng.

355
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,960
As the captain,
you have to set a good example.

356
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,750
(Six, seven...)

357
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,750
I got 20/20 vision.

358
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,680
I can even see what Korean drama

359
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,160
the other team is watching

360
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:42,920
and which the episode is from here.

361
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,240
With such excellent eyesight,

362
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,500
do I still need to do this?

363
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,940
(Six, seven, eight.)

364
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,920
(Seven, two, three, four.)

365
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,400
ZGDX really got renovated

366
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,200
while I was gone.

367
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,310
A family should do things together.

368
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,110
This is the new computer the club sent you?

369
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:02,750
Correct.

370
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,680
I don't ever have to fight
for a seat with that fool again.

371
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,030
What era is this now?

372
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,720
How are you guys still doing eye exercises?

373
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,310
I bought you guys eye protection lamps.

374
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:13,880
You guys won't have to
worry about eyes stinging,

375
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,720
no matter how long you have to stare at
the computer in the future.

376
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,510
Everyone has got one.

377
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,480
You have to use it!

378
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,510
That's thoughtful of you.

379
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,510
Of course.

380
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,350
Fool.

381
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,960
Come here!

382
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:27,830
Stupid.

383
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,310
Get over here.

384
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,260
(Triple Kill)
(Assist)

385
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,540
(Ultra Kill)
(Assist)

386
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,140
(Defeat)

387
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,400
(Shorty, how long will you keep training?)

388
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,310
(I'll keep training as long as)

389
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,640
(you do.)

390
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,790
(I'll keep training as long as)

391
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,000
(you do.)

392
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,030
(Why are you copying me?)

393
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,480
(Why are you copying me?)

394
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,640
Jinyang, how are you with Ai Jia?

395
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,070
Looks like you guys got back together.

396
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,270
I placed him
on the list of intern boyfriends.

397
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,200
We'll see how it goes.

398
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,960
You guys have been together for six years,

399
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,920
and he's been on your intern list six times.

400
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,270
He was never fired.

401
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,880
I'll shut up.

402
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,590
(The headshots and schedules
are out for the new season playoff.)

403
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,550
(Take a look.)

404
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,510
What is it?

405
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,030
Headshots for the National League.

406
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,440
National League?

407
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:29,270
The National League that

408
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,510
you're going to host.

409
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,640
Jinyang,

410
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,400
you should at least

411
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,480
learn a little bit about your part-time job.

412
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,160
I just need to show up looking pretty.

413
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,480
I don't need to know this.

414
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,510
Your biggest fan has decided to host

415
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,640
to show her support for you.

416
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,000
What are you sighing for?

417
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,030
Because of Lu Yue,

418
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,830
our team hasn't yet decide in the lineups.

419
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,160
It has to be you!

420
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,270
My bestie is so awesome!

421
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,440
Not necessarily.

422
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,590
Cheng said he needs to be fair.

423
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:56,590
I'm quite worried

424
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,440
how to get him

425
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,270
to lean toward me.

426
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,590
Don't worry.

427
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,310
Girls must have confidence in themselves.

428
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,750
Let me take you to choose your battle suit.

429
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:05,590
Battle suit?

430
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,920
What's that?

431
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,110
Our team just finished
choosing the team uniform.

432
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:09,880
It's different.

433
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,880
This is not the same kind of battle suit.

434
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,110
This.

435
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,920
This is what you mean?

436
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,400
Go try it on.

437
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,310
A perfect woman

438
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:29,160
will need to respond to all emergencies

439
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,030
with her sexy look.

440
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,880
I'm going to take headshots,

441
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,270
not wedding photos.

442
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,200
Well said.

443
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:38,480
Tomorrow marks the first time of
you and Cheng taking a photo together.

444
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,030
I hope that the next time
I see you guys together in a photo,

445
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,750
it would be one on a marriage certificate

446
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,070
taken at the Civil Affairs Bureau.

447
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,400
You're thinking way too much.

448
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,880
Best wishes to you.

449
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,160
My silly bestie captured the heart of
the God of E-sports.

450
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,790
If that day comes,

451
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,880
I can brag about it for a lifetime.

452
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,200
How did I have a friend like you?

453
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,920
This black clothes being too transparent,
how can I wear it inside?

454
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,550
Am I going to play or not?

455
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,350
Blurry beauty, you get it?

456
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,880
Then try this on.

457
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,510
Get cracking.

458
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,270
Go.

459
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,030
This is so cute.

460
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,270
Even underage girls

461
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,720
don't dress like that anymore.

462
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,000
I like it.

463
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,350
Okay then.

464
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,400
Go try both of these on.

465
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,680
Is it necessary?

466
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,680
Alright.

467
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,510
Since the starting players
haven't been decided yet,

468
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,030
there's no use in worrying about it now.

469
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,270
Anyway, you have to get your photos
taken tomorrow,

470
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,270
show your Captain

471
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,640
with your spirit

472
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,880
that you're his best partner.

473
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,590
When the CP photo of you and Cheng
gets published,

474
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,030
the Internet opinion might be so enthusiastic

475
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,830
that the club will include you
in the lineups.

476
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,310
Alright, let's go!

477
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,680
Please, please.

478
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,400
Go, go, go.

479
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,720
Why do you look like you're lying on
the chopping board

480
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,480
when you should be enjoying the spa,

481
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:08,200
sighing from time to time?

482
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,510
Jinyang,

483
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,070
since Lu Yue is back,

484
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:12,920
am I no longer

485
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,310
part of the lineups
for this new season of playoffs?

486
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,160
You've said this

487
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,550
countless times today.

488
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,310
Keep yourself positive.

489
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,550
What's yours will be yours.

490
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,640
If not, you can't take it by force?

491
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:29,790
Okay?

492
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,160
Yeah.

493
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,440
Jinyang,

494
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,720
since Lu Yue is back,

495
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,110
won't I be able to play as a starting player?

496
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,110
Say something.

497
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,510
Jinyang,

498
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,310
am I not going to be…

499
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,110
You're not going to be the starting player.

500
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,270
I'm leaving.

501
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,510
Go.

502
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,550
Come on, Yao.

503
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:23,960
Bye!

504
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,750
Look what they did in the team fight.

505
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,030
I don't understand
what they are hesitating for.

506
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,350
Has to be a surprise attack.

507
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,550
Look at the economy on the other side.

508
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,480
Honey, honey.

509
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,200
Honey.

510
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,240
Honey.

511
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,350
Honey.

512
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,270
Why didn't you visit me?

513
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,440
You put on make-up

514
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:14,920
and styled your hair!

515
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,350
It's a pity that there is no camera
next to the water dispenser.

516
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,440
Lu Yue, you better be kind.

517
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,880
Why are you sitting in my chair

518
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,510
and eating my snacks?

519
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,440
Give it to me.

520
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,350
This stuff is fat.

521
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,920
I'm sharing your burden.

522
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,030
This is healthy food.

523
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,000
What do you know?

524
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,920
It's not fat.

525
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,750
Tong Yao,

526
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,640
can I have a moment?

527
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,200
What's up, Cheng?

528
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,880
You want some dried mango?

529
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,720
It's very sweet.

530
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,070
What is this?

531
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,550
How are you going to use the keyboard
with so many things on your nails?

532
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,880
Also, the long eyelashes.

533
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,070
Won't it cover your sight?

534
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,440
Are you trying to suffocate your teammates

535
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,160
with your strong perfume

536
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,440
and lose the game?

537
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,070
If you want to be the starting player,

538
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,680
focus on your training.

539
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,440
Don't do anything meaningless.

540
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,960
I caught a backroom deal at the scene.

541
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:31,640
Delete it.

542
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,510
Nope.

543
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,200
If you dare to tell mom again,

544
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,310
I won't be nice to you.

545
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,310
Cheng, you've changed!

546
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,400
Yao,

547
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,680
I forgot to tell you.

548
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,960
Guess who I bumped into
the day before yesterday?

549
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:03,960
A ghost?

550
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,070
Hell no.

551
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,030
I bumped into my roommate.

552
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,960
She is with our class monitor now.

553
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:11,880
(Such a heartless
and thick-skinned girl like her)

554
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,240
was blushing and all shy
in front of our class monitor.

555
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,270
I could see her heart

556
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,510
pumping like crazy.

557
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,400
Her heart pumping like crazy?

558
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,880
Sounds like the reaction of
seeing a ghost to me.

559
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,200
Don't interrupt me.

560
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:24,000
Tong Yao.

561
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,000
What?

562
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:28,440
Did Biscuit eat your manicure and eyelashes

563
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,720
that we did together?

564
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,070
Cheng didn't like it.

565
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,550
Yao,

566
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,920
I've realized that

567
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,240
Cheng is the only one
who can have a say over you now.

568
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,790
How did we get to Cheng again?

569
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,480
You literally crumbled

570
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,920
at the bar last time.

571
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,550
Cheng took you away,

572
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,680
and you went back to normal the second day.

573
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:51,270
Tell me,

574
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,880
did he do something to you?

575
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,680
Be honest with me.

576
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:02,510
Do you feel joy, a speedy heart rate,

577
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:05,110
and blood rushing to your face

578
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,270
whenever you think of Cheng?

579
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,140
(Don't come back too late.)

580
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,790
You have three seconds.

581
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:44,720
Answer quickly.

582
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,480
If you don't answer,
then I'll take it as a yes.

583
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,110
Have you fallen for Cheng?

584
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:53,790
I…

585
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,000
Have you?

586
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,110
Tell me.

587
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,400
Yao.

588
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,030
You are in love.

589
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,310
Biscuit.

590
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:26,750
Why didn't you knock on the door?

591
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,830
Why didn't you lock the door?

592
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,960
I forgot to.

593
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,960
I was too lazy.

594
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,550
I thought you rolled off the bed.

595
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:34,400
(Oh my goodness, Cheng,)

596
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,160
(you guys are really together!)

597
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,350
Everyone went to bed quite early today?

598
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,880
We have to take promotional photos soon,

599
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,440
so I had everyone go to bed early.

600
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,590
You're really a team bully.

601
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,030
Cheng,

602
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,790
(why are you coming out from here?)

603
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,310
She just rolled off the bed,

604
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,160
I went to give a hand,

605
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,310
and see a joke by the way.

606
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,070
Listen,

607
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,160
she fell off again.

608
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,400
Well, are you going to go in
and give her another hand?

609
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,640
Forget it.

610
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,200
People must learn to grow on their own.

611
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:56,820
(Tong Yao)

612
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,750
(Mocked me again.)

613
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,680
(I heard it.)

614
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:03,920
(I won't bring you to victory tomorrow.)

615
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,920
(Remember to take your medication
before going to bed.)

616
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,440
(You have to treat your crazy disease
as soon as possible.)

617
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,310
(The sun came out from the west?)

618
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,510
(Night owl old man)

619
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,680
(actually woke up early
in the morning to read?)

620
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,640
Come on.

621
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,460
(Doce Cuentos Peregrinos)

622
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,200
(What a profound book title.)

623
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,880
(I can't understand it.)

624
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:25,880
Yao,

625
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,750
you are in love.

626
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,480
Go away.

627
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,790
Cheng, you're up so early.

628
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:42,030
The mid-season game today includes CK,

629
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,030
so I got up early to take a look.

630
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,240
Did it win?

631
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,350
Smashed Red Arrow and Obsidian,

632
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,310
and got destroyed by Alpha, as always.

633
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,240
Feel a joy, a speedy heart rate,

634
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,350
- and blood rushing to your face...
- Shut up.

635
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:04,880
What?

636
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,270
Nothing.

637
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,000
What are you doing?

638
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,790
There is a hair on your hair.

639
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,790
Biscuit's hair.

640
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,510
I'm training my waist and abdomen today.

641
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,960
Yao, want to go work out?

642
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,760
- Go go.
- Let's go.

643
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,240
- Let's go, gym time.
- Let's go.

644
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,360
- Go.
- Let's go.

645
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,710
Healthy nuts,

646
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,960
healthy life.

647
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,800
Not bad.

648
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,960
Muscle.

649
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,840
You're not the starting player
for the National League,

650
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,710
why are you training so hard?

651
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,190
You are the starting player either,

652
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,320
and why are you so serious?

653
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,110
It's already a done deal.

654
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,400
Don't make your assumption
sound like a fact.

655
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,280
You can't afford to scare me to death.

656
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,400
I'll definitely be the starting player.

657
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,150
You will definitely not be.

658
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:03,280
Why are you copying me?

659
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,110
When did I copy you?

660
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:08,440
Childish.

661
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,230
Cat.

662
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,440
What is it?

663
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,150
Have you ever seen a dummy this close up?

664
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,670
Dummy?

665
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,590
Where?

666
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,440
There.

667
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,150
What happened to them?

668
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,670
And you.

669
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,280
What's that smell?

670
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,710
Dummy.

671
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,960
You can't be serious.

672
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,840
We got our new team uniforms.

673
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,360
The team uniforms are here. Take a look.

674
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,230
How is it?

675
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:21,590
This is better.

676
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,400
Weren't you the one who said

677
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,960
black will show shapes and look better?

678
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,630
Just right.

679
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,110
This is call make the best of what you got,

680
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,230
okay?

681
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,960
Didn't you say you are afraid of getting fat?

682
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,070
That's such a lie.

683
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,550
You're not even half the size of my uniform.

684
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,030
When a girl says they're fat,

685
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,000
can you believe her?

686
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,550
It's not a question of being fat or skinny.

687
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,880
It's just that everything she wears
looks like children's garments.

688
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,000
What did you say?

689
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,030
Can you be polite?

690
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,440
Who wears children's garments?

691
