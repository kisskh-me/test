1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,520
I'm not good at Tamamo-no-Mae at all.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,910
I don't deserve to be the No.1 Tamamo-no-Mae
on the Chinese server.

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:09,320
Won't she be devastated from now on

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:10,480
and not dare to play ever again, will she?

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,000
Rui, I'm going out for a while.

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:12,830
It's already eleven o'clock.

7
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,190
Why isn't Tong Yao back?

8
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:16,000
Could the silly girl have gone to
jump into the sea?

9
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,830
Hello, bring me another glass
of iced black tea.

10
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:20,600
Hell no.

11
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,120
That's Long Island Iced Tea.

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,920
But I saw on the internet

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,480
the newcomer Smiling you recruited

14
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,670
was beaten up by Tai.

15
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,870
I wasn't beaten up.

16
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,030
I'm actually really good.

17
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:32,430
Am I going to be a substitute's substitute?

18
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,880
You can't keep me on the bench.

19
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,320
I just lost one game.

20
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,520
I don't want to guard the water dispenser.

21
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,470
(Alcohol may take your mind off
your sorrows for a while.)

22
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,880
(But we won't.)

23
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,600
They can say what they want to say.

24
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:50,000
We'll just focus on our own thing.

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,840
Jian Yang.

26
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,350
You don't know me at all.

27
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,750
You don't even know what I care about.

28
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,880
What I care about

29
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,960
is never what those people
on the Internet say.

30
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,390
I don't like to drag my teammates down.

31
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,640
As her teammates,

32
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,480
we must understand her at a moment like this.

33
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,790
To me, Tamamo-no-Mae is...

34
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,150
Like a sort of faith.

35
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,710
How about building a new faith

36
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,480
in regard to the determination to win?

37
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,920
(Smiling.)

38
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,430
(It's time to get up and face it.)

39
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,460
=Falling in Your Smile=

40
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,220
=Episode 07=

41
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,280
Who are you, Miss?

42
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,430
Good morning, Rui.

43
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,400
Good morning.

44
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,800
Your performance last night was great.

45
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,960
Cheng, why don't you let me
be the starting player?

46
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,030
I don't want to
guard the water dispenser over there.

47
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,520
I'll sing a song for you.

48
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,910
Could you let me be the starting player?

49
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:16,160
Flying Bugs... Flying Bugs...

50
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,950
Who are you thinking of?

51
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,750
How is it? Is it any good?

52
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,510
How's my singing?

53
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,830
Cheng, I want to be the starting player.

54
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,040
I'll sing one more song.

55
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,310
Will you let me be the starting player?

56
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,480
Ready, go.

57
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,560
The stars in the sky are flying.

58
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,510
The flowers on the ground are wilting.

59
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,600
Flying Bugs... Flying Bugs...

60
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,800
Who are you thinking of?

61
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,750
Let me be the starting player.

62
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,070
Let go of me. Let go of me.

63
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,630
Don't move.

64
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,680
Cheng.

65
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,720
Are you going to hurt me

66
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,040
just so your younger brother
can be the starting player?

67
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,270
No, I'm the No.1 player of Tamamo-no-Mae
on the Chinese server.

68
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,680
You can't do this to me.

69
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,120
Cheng, your little girlfriend
is quite a fighter.

70
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,360
Shut up.

71
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,510
Open her mouth.

72
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,750
Come on, open your mouth.

73
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,800
Come on, take the medicine.

74
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,190
Don't bite my hand.

75
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,040
Drink some water.

76
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,040
Come on, drink some water.

77
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,480
Drink it.

78
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,700
(Who do you want, Lv or me?)

79
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,700
(You're not really abandoning me,
are you? Boo-hoo...)

80
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,020
(I have a dream
and I want to be a professional.)

81
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,020
(I want to win the world championship.)

82
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,920
Wukong.

83
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,270
Where is my yogurt?

84
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,950
There were five or six cans last night
before I went to bed.

85
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,360
What are you doing?

86
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,120
What the hell are you doing?

87
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,830
Thinking about my life.

88
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,360
Thinking about your life?

89
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,190
Starting from what moment?

90
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,630
Let me guess.

91
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,510
From

92
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,800
one second before you were born,

93
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,830
or about 15 hours ago

94
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,120
when you had your first glass of
Long Island Iced Tea?

95
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,480
I guess it's the latter.

96
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,830
Because what happened at that time

97
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:44,070
is complicated enough
to make you think for a long time.

98
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,240
Captain.

99
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,680
Did I do a lot of improper things last night?

100
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,630
Improper?

101
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,000
No, how come?

102
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,000
Which one do you mean exactly?

103
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:04,950
You mean

104
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,800
When you were so scared that
you thought he was a ghost

105
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,830
when seeing my brother,

106
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,070
or when you cried that

107
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,560
you were too good

108
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,510
to be a substitute,

109
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,390
otherwise, you would lose the whole world.

110
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,190
That's when you even started to
sing "Flying Bugs".

111
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,310
By the way,

112
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:16,950
I should advise you.

113
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,870
You really shouldn't sing anymore.

114
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,310
Because you really turned
a children's song into a ghost's song.

115
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,800
You also forced your teammates to accept

116
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,480
the tissues after blowing your nose
one by one,

117
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,310
saying they were farewell gifts.

118
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:27,920
No refusal was accepted.

119
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,920
Otherwise, you'd hug him and then cry.

120
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,800
You even licked your cat's hair in the end,

121
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,150
and kept your cat's ear in your mouth.

122
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,270
Several people couldn't even pull you off.

123
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,390
You even bit people in the end.

124
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,120
To be frank,

125
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,120
I woke up early

126
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,600
to go get a rabies vaccination.

127
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,550
So, did you take your medicine?

128
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,000
What kind of medicine?

129
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,150
A sobriety pill.

130
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,910
It's put on your doorstep.

131
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,390
How can your illness get better
without medication?

132
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,600
Stop it. Stop it.

133
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,120
I know I'm wrong.

134
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,150
Who knew that drink had alcohol in it?

135
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,150
It's called Long Island Iced Tea.

136
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,790
Because there's no sweetheart
in sweetheart pastry.

137
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,790
There's no squirrel
in Squirrel Mandarin Fish.

138
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,480
There is no Lei Feng in the Leifeng Tower.

139
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,270
So of course,
Long Island Iced Tea is not tea.

140
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,240
Bumpkin.

141
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,320
And

142
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,000
what do you think
you're doing downstairs in your pajamas?

143
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,080
What do you want to do with this mask?

144
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,840
You want to scare us to death so that
you can kill us and silence us for good?

145
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,600
Can I not take off the mask?

146
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,630
Why are you wearing this?

147
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,870
It's embarrassing.

148
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,240
You mean you know what's embarrassing?

149
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,630
That's not what you said
when you asked us to guard your dirty tissues

150
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,630
after blowing your nose yesterday.

151
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,670
I won't listen, I won't listen.

152
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,600
Get up and change your clothes.

153
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,750
They're about to wake up.

154
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,340
(Switch to voice chat)

155
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,420
(Amao's Mom)

156
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,030
Hey, Yao, what's up?

157
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,670
Looking for me?

158
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,720
Are you sober?

159
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,120
What exactly happened at the bar yesterday?

160
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,720
I have no idea.

161
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,200
Nothing else matters.

162
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,320
You just need to remember

163
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,600
it was Cheng

164
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,670
who carried you away

165
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,120
in front of your ex-boyfriend.

166
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,600
Ex-boyfriend?

167
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,240
Jian Yang was there too?

168
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,030
I blame the idiot Ai Jia.

169
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,390
He just had to call him to come there.

170
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,120
Honey.

171
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,080
Who are you calling an idiot?

172
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,000
Who's there?

173
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,910
(Tong Yao)
(Something's going on?)

174
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,980
(Message: Yao, are you awake?)

175
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,270
(Let's get back together, Yao.)

176
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:00,270
(Yao, have you returned to the base?)

177
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,550
(Where are you?)

178
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,080
(You'll get a headache
in the morning after drinking.)

179
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,240
(Remember to drink some hot water.)

180
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,320
Take this.

181
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,080
No.

182
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,150
I asked you to take it.

183
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,320
Just take it.

184
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,720
You look like a big idiot.

185
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,910
Shut up.

186
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,510
There are too many people
in the supermarket today.

187
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:26,960
It's crowding me to death.

188
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,080
I think it's all right.

189
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,120
- Come on
- It's okay.

190
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,440
Look, Chubby. They all taste good.

191
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,200
What food?

192
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,360
Tong Yao.

193
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,240
You're up so early
to play double-queues with Cheng?

194
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:37,870
How's your record coming along?

195
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,960
Hello, Chubby.

196
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,200
How come it's you?

197
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,270
Lu Yue, why are you back?

198
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,000
I'm back.

199
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,240
What's wrong?

200
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,150
What?

201
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,240
I just got suspended.

202
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,200
It's not like I retired.

203
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,720
Why are you all so surprised?

204
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,000
Cheng.

205
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,240
Where are Rui and Ming?

206
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,120
Do they know?

207
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,630
We ran into each other last night.

208
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,870
I'm going to look for Ming.

209
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,080
Smiling.

210
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,270
What's your new trick?

211
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:36,320
She's ashamed to face people.

212
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,550
Why are you still here?

213
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,720
Because the team needs me.

214
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,440
No.

215
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,320
Yes.

216
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,240
No.

217
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,840
- Yes.
- No.

218
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,120
This is my spot.

219
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:45,960
Is it?

220
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,840
Call it by name then,

221
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,030
and see if it makes any reaction.

222
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:48,910
You get up.

223
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,630
No.

224
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,440
- You get up.
- No.

225
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,630
Oh my God, Cat.

226
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,360
Why are you licking my cat's ears?

227
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,790
Both of us are about to
reach 24-year-old.

228
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,960
Why are you still acting like retards?

229
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,510
She's more of a retard, isn't she?

230
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,910
Made some kind of stupid lie for a chair.

231
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,320
Yet somehow you bought it.

232
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,390
You're even dumber.

233
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,480
Anyway, it's my chair now.

234
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,510
Whatever you say.

235
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,510
Biscuit.

236
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:27,750
When did I lick your ears?

237
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,120
What's going on?

238
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,670
Why are you eating with a chair?

239
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,670
Afraid I'll steal yours?

240
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,510
This is the chair that belongs to
the starting midsolo.

241
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,840
You're the worst midsolo
in the history of my team.

242
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,600
But still better than you as a substitute.

243
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,630
Not bad.

244
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,030
The food has been upgraded
while I was away.

245
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,080
What are you doing?

246
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,000
You're not eating?

247
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,360
No.

248
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,240
I'll eat over there.

249
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,910
How long are you going to be crazy for?

250
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,790
When will you leave?

251
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,790
Until I'm too old to hold a mouse.

252
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,510
Until he is too old to hold a mouse,

253
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,270
and doesn't compete with me
to be the starting midsolo.

254
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,840
Save it for

255
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,840
when you can beat Tai.

256
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,270
That's enough.

257
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,390
You've already lost your face.

258
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,150
Wearing a mask won't save your dignity.

259
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,150
Eat.

260
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,910
K, Chubby.

261
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,910
Why are you eating there?

262
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,030
You're fighting over the chair too?

263
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,630
What's wrong?

264
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,630
I don't want to eat here either.

265
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,080
It's not suitable for me to stay here.

266
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,550
No way.

267
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,910
I'm here to avenge ZGDX.

268
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,360
I was thinking about
why I couldn't fall asleep.

269
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,440
Some people not only take my place,

270
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,790
but also make a mess of my account.

271
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,120
Brat.

272
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:00,550
Cheng, why don't you
take care of her cursing?

273
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,030
Didn't you go to bed already?

274
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,080
Why are you down here again?

275
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,480
There are always unruly people
who want to occupy my spot.

276
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,870
How can I sleep in peace?

277
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,550
Look who's here?

278
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,600
Tai?

279
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,670
Will you go for it?

280
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,000
Does he know who's in the fight?

281
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,870
He has chosen Tamamo-no-Mae.

282
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,030
Why do you still choose Higanbana?

283
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,670
I'm playing this time.

284
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,030
Why panic?

285
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,000
Do you think

286
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,840
he can still show off this time?

287
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,790
You and your brother
really have the same character.

288
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,030
Condescending and arrogant.

289
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,910
Watch your language.

290
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,390
Anyway, whether
you'll win or lose this time,

291
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,080
I guess the image of me as a retard

292
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,600
has been ingrained

293
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,790
in Tai's mind.

294
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,000
Sooner or later,
I'll grind him beneath my heel,

295
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,360
and defeat him.

296
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,080
Why do you care what he thinks?

297
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,030
Are you out of your mind?

298
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,590
Keep tabbing.

299
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:15,480
What's wrong with you?

300
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,680
What's the point?

301
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,160
You can't kill it and you'll also miss
the money from the soldiers.

302
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,070
Are you stupid?

303
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,440
Want to run?

304
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,590
Where to?

305
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,830
Good job.

306
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,440
You're not bad.

307
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,110
Don't hit me.

308
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,830
Cheng, take her way.

309
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,830
I missed a soldier.

310
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,000
Intrigued me again?

311
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,000
Tai is not so smart either.

312
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,240
Trying to trap me twice in the same way?

313
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:58,750
No.

314
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,510
I'm the one who's not smart.

315
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:01,920
Yes.

316
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:03,510
He can only fool you.

317
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,920
He even came to my place to get killed.

318
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,960
He looks like he has helpers.

319
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,110
Trying to set me up?

320
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,160
No way, my friend.

321
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,830
I also have my teammates.

322
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,240
Why do you let others kill him?

323
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,070
But to be honest,

324
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,480
if it were me,

325
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,310
I would have fought with them.

326
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,310
I'm a wimp.

327
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,830
It's safer to be a wimp.

328
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,310
Yes.

329
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,720
Good for you.

330
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,310
Nice.

331
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,350
I have to admit,

332
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,200
you're quite something.

333
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,550
Do you know what it means
to come prepared?

334
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,880
I've studied all of

335
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,200
Tai's videos of playing games before.

336
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,920
I also played
as a substitute for Ming before.

337
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,590
Whenever he needed a defensive midsolo,

338
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,680
I'd be on the bench.

339
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,030
That's why last season's results

340
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:16,960
were quite a success.

341
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,640
What's the point?

342
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,640
What's the point of
having the best results of finalist season?

343
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,880
We still didn't even go to the finals

344
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,200
because of someone...

345
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,070
And finally gave
the trophy to the opponent.

346
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,640
Think about it.

347
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,400
Who actually led to

348
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,750
Ming's severe hand injury?

349
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,240
I don't know what you think.

350
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,070
I still stick to my opinion.

351
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,680
If this guy should be a substitute,

352
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,400
that's fine.

353
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,830
That's the choice of the club.

354
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,400
But I personally

355
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,510
don't accept this kind of teammate.

356
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,110
You guys go on. I'll go check it out.

357
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,920
It's been so long since this happened.

358
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,480
Why mention it?

359
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,030
Ming himself didn't say anything.

360
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,510
Do you think everyone is like you,

361
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,590
being all okay
only if they don't mention about it?

362
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,440
Why are you being mean to me?

363
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,590
He's right.

364
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,590
It's my fault.

365
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,640
Continue your gaming.

366
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,030
(Do you know what it means
to come prepared?)

367
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,240
(I've studied)

368
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,350
(all of Tai's videos of
playing games before.)

369
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,920
(I also played as a substitute
for Ming before.)

370
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,480
(Whenever he needed
a defensive midsolo,)

371
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,590
(I'd be on the bench.)

372
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,720
(Jinyang, I lost to a substitute.)

373
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,440
(I saw he was quite good at
playing midsolo.)

374
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,440
(Better than me.)

375
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,550
(What should I do?)

376
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:36,030
(I feel like I can't hold
my position as the starting player.)

377
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,880
(I loathe myself. I'm not happy.)

378
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,200
(I'm emotional.)

379
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,350
(I feel vulnerable again.)

380
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,750
We still didn't even go to the finals,

381
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,030
because of someone,

382
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,590
and finally gave
the trophy to the opponent.

383
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:00,460
(ZGDX withdrew the game)

384
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,030
(ZGDX won this year's championship)

385
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,750
(during the spring finals of
the Onmyoji Arena Pro League.)

386
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:07,750
(And the team fought all the way,)

387
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,030
(as if they were invincible,)

388
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,960
(in the National League.)

389
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:12,110
(Just when everyone thought ZGDX)

390
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,550
(was in closed training,)

391
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,550
(preparing for the national finals of)

392
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,640
(the Onmyoji Arena Pro League,)

393
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:18,030
(ZGDX officially announced
some shocking news.)

394
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,240
(ZGDX)

395
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,030
(withdrew from the national finals of)

396
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,070
(the Onmyoji Arena Pro League.)

397
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,270
(The Internet was full of curses
at that time.)

398
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,790
(Some said that ZGDX
was withdrawn from investments,)

399
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,480
(and faced disbandment.)

400
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,830
(Some said that there was a problem
among the members.)

401
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,030
(They couldn't play at all.)

402
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,270
(Some even said
they just couldn't handle the pressure)

403
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,030
(and gave up.)

404
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:29,830
(All in all, there were a lot of stories.)

405
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,270
(But there was no accurate answer
in the end.)

406
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,350
(A year ago, in the finals,)

407
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,920
(ZGDX was not
on the list of participants.)

408
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,440
Think about it.

409
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,200
Who actually led to

410
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,480
Ming's severe hand injury?

411
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,000
(Does Lu Yue have something to do with)

412
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,720
(these so-called stories that)

413
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,590
(even Ming was involved in?)

414
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,420
(Lu Yue Withdrew the Game)

415
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,000
(Is no one discussing that did Smiling)

416
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,510
(just take revenge on Tai?)

417
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,310
(The general channel for the South Korean server
is now heatedly discussing about it.)

418
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,640
(Is it possible that Lv played for her?)

419
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,030
(Lu Yue has ruined Ming.)

420
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:07,750
(Don't come out)

421
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:09,480
(to sabotage
the Chinese e-sports industry, okay?)

422
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,590
(Speaking of the starting player,)

423
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,270
(I still support Smiling.)

424
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,350
That's weird.

425
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,550
How do they know Lu Yue is back?

426
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:34,030
I don't know how Ming and Rui
think about it.

427
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,830
I really didn't intentionally provoke it.

428
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,030
What was his attitude like today?

429
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,200
You saw it, right?

430
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,960
We can't just let this event pass.

431
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:43,270
Someone has to say something, right?

432
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,030
I thought after all this time,

433
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,270
he could change.

434
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,440
But

435
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,480
he just casually

436
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,830
came back

437
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:51,960
as if nothing had happened.

438
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,550
And he even had the nerve to say that
he once was the substitute of Ming.

439
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:56,480
Look at this.

440
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:59,160
(Been here!)
He even announced it to the whole world,

441
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,510
as if nothing had happened.

442
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,720
Maybe he thought it had faded away

443
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,310
after a year.

444
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,160
But Ming's hand...

445
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,440
Are you pretending to be ghosts here,

446
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,640
not sleeping at midnight?

447
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:15,960
Why aren't you asleep?

448
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,480
I can't sleep.

449
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,550
Why? You ate too much?

450
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,070
Because of Lu Yue, right?

451
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,550
You all saw the game today.

452
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,350
Lu Yue was indeed more stable
than me in playing the game.

453
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,790
Maybe it'll make more sense

454
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,070
if he is the starting midsolo.

455
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,000
Don't worry.

456
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,000
Lu Yue will definitely
not be the starting player.

457
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,750
Not all mistakes

458
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,350
can be covered up by time.

459
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,110
What do you mean?

460
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,720
All right, Tong Yao.

461
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,880
Don't think too much.

462
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,510
Go to bed right after
you've finished drinking.

463
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:49,640
I'm too sleepy.

464
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,640
I'm going to leave now.

465
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,510
Good night.

466
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,240
Good night.

467
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,960
(Jinyang)

468
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,200
Hello?

469
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,310
(You're still sleeping, Yao?)

470
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,880
(Oh my god, something big
is going on in your team.)

471
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,400
(Watch the video I sent you.)

472
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,310
(Our Ming's hand.)

473
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,160
(Oh my God, I'm going to cry.)

474
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,960
(This video was released by Smiling, right?)

475
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,070
(She looks like a sweetheart, normally.)

476
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,750
(But she's got a lot of evil intentions
behind her back.)

477
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:04,640
(Maybe she released this video)

478
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,310
(because she's afraid that Lu Yue)

479
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,960
(will steal her chance to be
the starting player in the National League.)

480
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,400
(Good point.)

481
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,880
(What a cunning bitch.)

482
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,110
Okay, don't worry.

483
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,680
Don't worry, we'll take care of it properly.

484
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,720
Yes, we as the authority...

485
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,240
It absolutely has no impact
on the daily operation of the team.

486
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,680
There is absolutely no problem
among our players.

487
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,310
Don't worry, we've prepared
a letter from the lawyer.

488
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:38,790
We still need to ask you

489
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,240
to discuss it with the headquarters.

490
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,680
Please talk about it. Don't give up.

491
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,480
I'll treat you someday

492
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,240
to show my gratitude, Mr. Xu.

493
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,070
What's the situation?

494
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,960
I'll give you a few more tickets
for the next competition.

495
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:46,790
Focus on your own business.
This is it for now.

496
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:47,920
- Okay
- Please, please.

497
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,960
All right.

498
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,400
Cheng, where's Chubby?

499
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,830
He went to the bathroom.

500
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,830
He said he'd be right down.

501
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,480
Hello, Tong Yao.

502
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,640
I'm the one running the official account.

503
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,590
The official account is now overwhelmingly
judged by people.

504
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,110
There're a lot of people complaining about
Lv and asking for the truth.

505
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:04,830
And Miss Tong.

506
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,590
The fact that you gave a thumbs-up
to a blog by mistake

507
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,790
is now also on the top

508
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:08,830
of the comment section.

509
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,270
Look at it.

510
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,030
The following are all malicious comments.

511
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,030
Laugh your ass off.

512
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:15,680
We can't just remain silent

513
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,880
and not reply this time.

514
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,070
We have to think of a solution
as soon as possible.

515
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,400
Lu Yue, stop looking through it.

516
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,000
There are barely
even a few positive comments.

517
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,750
Don't read it.

518
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,160
Rui, I'm going to solve the problems
of the official account.

519
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,960
Hello?

520
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,000
You regret it, right?

521
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,880
I told you back then.

522
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,920
Professional players
are also half public figures,

523
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,070
who should behave
differently from in school.

524
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,440
Keep a low profile,

525
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,270
in case you harm others as well as yourself.

526
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,590
First of all,

527
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,510
it's definitely targeted at Lu Yue.

528
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,830
He just returned to the club
after his suspension

529
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,480
before someone released the video.

530
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,880
It's obviously

531
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,030
to prevent him from returning
by means of public opinion.

532
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,550
Only our own people in the team have

533
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,110
this video.

534
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,550
To be honest,

535
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,200
why would the news

536
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,000
be so well sealed off back then?

537
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,480
Because there were absolutely
no more than 20 people

538
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,830
who saw this video,

539
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,030
or had access to this video

540
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,310
plus the staff of the KTV and the police.

541
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,920
The security guards of
the KTV and the police,

542
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,720
were a group of middle-aged people
in their 30s and 40s.

543
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,030
In their opinion,

544
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,160
it had nothing to do with e-sports.

545
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,640
It was just a group of young people
fighting and brawling.

546
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,310
The rest of the people who know about this

547
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,310
are members of our club as well as JK.

548
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,480
People of JK

549
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,000
definitely wouldn't dare
have released the video.

550
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,790
Because in terms of
public opinion suppression,

551
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,240
releasing this video

552
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,790
wouldn't benefit them at all.

553
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,720
It was also the result of our joint decision

554
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,510
to suppress it at that time.

555
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:43,000
They acted even more eager
to do this than we did.

556
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:44,680
Why?

557
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,440
Didn't Lu Yue start it?

558
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,880
But they fought back.

559
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:49,750
In self-defense?

560
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:51,750
That's not how self-defense works.

561
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,920
They were trying to subdue Lu Yue,

562
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:54,960
holding him down

563
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,310
and trying to grab the weapon he was holding.

564
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,510
That is called self-defense.

565
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,720
Then they beat him up.

566
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,000
That is called a mob fight.

567
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,200
But in my opinion,

568
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,350
it's also called deserving it.

569
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,680
All right, all right.

570
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,070
Anyway, this must have been

571
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,550
done by someone among us.

572
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,310
I don't know who it was.

573
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,550
But on behalf of the club,

574
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:15,680
I hope you can step up

575
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,440
to solve this properly.

576
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,750
There are so many rumors out there.

577
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:23,110
Everyone is on the edge of the storm.

578
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,750
If we don't unite internally at this time,

579
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,440
there will really be a big problem.

580
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,920
I posted the video.

581
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,480
Chubby?

582
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,270
I'm sorry, Tong Yao.

583
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,720
I didn't think you would get involved.

584
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,400
I only did this for Lu Yue.

585
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,880
With the same words being said,

586
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,790
that's fine

587
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,310
if he wants to be a substitute.

588
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,480
That's the club's choice.

589
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,640
But I personally

590
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,720
don't accept such a teammate.

591
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,960
Chubby, stop it.

592
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,790
You would agree to let

593
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,440
such a person return to the team?

594
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,350
I can't.

595
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,480
I won't accept it either.

596
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,240
What are you talking about?

597
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,400
He's to blame for Ming's retirement.

598
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,720
He has to give us all an explanation.

599
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:05,000
He's not to blame for my retirement.

600
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,270
Ming.

601
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,030
You think you can cover up all his mistakes

602
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,750
by shielding him like this?

603
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,200
Why did you have the fight?

604
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,440
Why did you get Ming involved in?

605
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,160
Why did you drag the whole team down?

606
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:21,110
You thought you looked cool
when you hit people with a bottle, right?

607
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,070
I was also very cranky and often fought

608
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:25,480
when I was in school.

609
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,590
But I don't do that anymore.

610
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:28,510
Why?

611
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:31,960
Because I knew I was a professional.

612
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,030
Fighting

613
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,640
would not only
get me punished and criticized,

614
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,440
but also affect my teammates, the club,

615
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,920
and even the entire industry of e-sports.

616
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,680
From a small perspective,

617
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,200
Ming's entire career

618
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,680
was ruined

619
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,790
because of your hit.

620
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,200
We couldn't go to the national finals

621
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,590
because of this shit too.

622
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,750
The whole team's efforts
for a whole year were in vain.

623
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,720
To put it in a big perspective,

624
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,240
Do you know what onlookers

625
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,880
say about e-sports industry?

626
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:56,830
They say we are internet addicts.

627
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,640
We don't do our jobs properly.

628
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,680
What's the point of just playing games?

629
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,350
I hear that every year.

630
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:05,550
I'm tired of hearing it,
but I still can't raise my head.

631
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:07,790
Because no matter how hard I try

632
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,790
to explain to others,

633
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,830
saying we're not like that,

634
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,110
we're not just punks
who only know how to play games,

635
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,310
then somehow there will be

636
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,790
stupid teammates like you who instead

637
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,720
prove millions of those people right

638
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,400
with your actions.

639
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,200
That we are what they say,

640
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:25,590
a bunch of losers.

641
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,720
(Amao's Mom)
(Oh my God.)

642
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,920
(The video was released by Chubby.)

643
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:36,590
(Chubby? That Chubby?)

644
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:38,750
Honey.

645
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:41,200
I've made you
a delicious breakfast with love.

646
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:46,200
Come on, have a glass of soy milk.

647
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,240
(Chubby is arguing with Lu Yue.)

648
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,000
(What should I do?)

649
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
(I feel so embarrassed.)

650
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,440
(Who am I, where am I and what am I doing?)

651
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,240
(The video was really released by Chubby?)

652
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:58,480
(Being in the same team,
why slaughter each other so frightfully?)

653
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,270
Honey.

654
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,440
You are talking about
the online video of the fight, right?

655
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,030
I was there at the time.

656
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,400
Who is your honey?

657
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,510
Mind your words.

658
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,750
You are still under review.

659
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:31,960
Don't make me deduct your points.

660
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,270
Ai Jia, are you crazy?

661
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,440
How dare you touch my lipstick?

662
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,240
Honey, don't be angry.

663
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,030
I'll show you something.

664
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,590
You see?

665
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:50,680
Light wave of love, BiuBiuBiu.

666
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,240
Screw you.

667
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,110
This is the love lipstick

668
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,590
I rushed to purchase.

669
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,270
Don't make me deduct your points.

670
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,550
Don't deduct my points.

671
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:58,960
How about this?

672
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,960
Do you want to know the truth of the event?

673
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,750
You know the truth?

674
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,880
Of course, I do.

675
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:09,440
The truth is often more than meets the eye.

676
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,160
Do you want to hear about it?

677
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,480
Just tell me if you want.

678
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,550
If not, get out.

679
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,200
Wait.

680
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,310
The person who caused such an accident

681
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,110
and brought us so much trouble

682
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,550
just simply wandered outside for a year.

683
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,160
Now he can pretend that
nothing happened

684
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,200
and that he doesn't have to
take responsibility for anything?

685
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:30,920
Why?

686
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,440
Chubby, you made a mistake.

687
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,200
Lu Yue didn't fight
with others for no reason.

688
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,640
It's because what they said

689
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,720
was so harsh.

690
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:38,830
That's why he started the fight.

691
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,680
In this situation, we all might...

692
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,750
I wouldn't.

693
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,200
Obviously, it was Lu Yue's fault.

694
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:46,110
Why are you guys trying to
cover for him all the time?

695
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:46,960
No need to say anymore.

696
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,640
I was just a scumbag

697
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,480
who was impulsive
and dragged my teammates down.

698
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,200
But what's the difference
between your posting the video

699
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,030
and my fighting?

700
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,070
You also dragged our teammates down,
didn't you?

701
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,240
The difference between you and me is that

702
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,440
I have a sense of shame.

703
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:58,590
I take responsibility for my mistakes

704
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,200
while you

705
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,200
are always a coward who runs away.

706
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:01,750
What did you say?!

707
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:02,590
I'll say it as many times as I please!

708
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,680
- You're a coward.
- Shut up.

709
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:05,000
- Coward.
- I dare you to say that again.

710
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,830
- Sit down.
- Coward.

711
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,310
You're just a coward.

712
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,960
All right, Chubby, stop it.

713
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:08,760
Sit down. Sit down.

714
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,710
Let's go. Go out and calm down.

715
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:10,840
What are you doing?

716
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,360
Lu Yue, calm down.

717
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,670
Take a chill pill. Calm down.

718
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,670
Calm down.

719
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,110
Out of sight, out of mind.

720
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,440
As long as Lu Yue doesn't show up
in front of me,

721
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,800
I'll feel much better.

722
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,670
I know

723
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:38,150
it's boring to say all this
in such a serious way.

724
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,000
But that's what I think.

725
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,480
I know I'm a professional.

726
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,400
It's not like I'm doing anything shameful.

727
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,960
But I can't maintain any dignity.

728
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,070
Why?

729
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,110
I know that

730
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,880
the way I handled it was a bit extreme.

731
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,670
But I just can't understand

732
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,960
how could a person like Lu Yue
return to the team?

733
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,920
So,

734
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,320
what exactly happened a year ago?

735
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,110
Come on.

736
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,630
It's been a rough day for you today.

737
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,590
Relax yourselves.

738
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,480
- That's right.
- Come on.

739
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,630
I'm sorry about today.

740
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,400
It was pure luck.

741
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,070
I won by a narrow margin.

742
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,030
Come on, let's have a drink.

743
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:19,070
Come on, come on.

744
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,880
To Mr. Bao and Mr. Pan.

745
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,880
I'll drink to that first.

746
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,400
Cheers.

747
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,030
It's supposed to be an exhibition match.

748
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:27,190
Chessman is not here?

749
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,030
He's not feeling well today.

750
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:29,710
That's why he didn't come.

751
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,230
Come on, come on.

752
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,030
He's not feeling well?

753
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,840
I thought he looked quite well

754
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,360
in the middle of the game just now.

755
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,030
He's clearly not showing respect to A.

756
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,000
No, no.

757
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,670
How come?

758
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,320
A, let me make a toast to you.

759
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,230
He's really not feeling well today.

760
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:44,710
Well.

761
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,960
Let's just say we had
a narrow victory today, okay?

762
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,550
Sorry.

763
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:48,960
A narrow victory?

764
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,440
You call two-love a narrow victory?

765
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,920
You're just looking down on us.

766
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,840
No, I'm not.

767
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,550
I...

768
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,670
Come on.

769
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,480
It was really pure luck today.

770
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:01,360
I'm drinking it for my brother.

771
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,800
I'll show you respect

772
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,030
To you all.

773
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,920
Yes, this is from Lu Yue.

774
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:11,800
This can be seen as being from Lu Yue.

775
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,320
Come on, I'll make a toast myself.

776
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,670
Come on, let's have a toast.

777
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,760
Come on, I'll fill it for you.

778
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,840
Come on, come on.

779
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,000
Come on.

780
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,440
Lu Yue. Lu Yue.

781
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,710
Good.

782
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,000
Good for you.

783
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:48,840
It's okay, it's okay.

784
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,460
You're the man.

785
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,550
Friendship comes first,
competition comes second, right?

786
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,840
Yes. Come on.

787
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,590
Are you okay?

788
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,480
Come on.

789
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,440
I'll make a toast to you all. Here.

790
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:54,920
I'll make a toast to you all.

791
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,150
- Come on
- Let's drink together.

792
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,000
- Come on
- Let's drink.

793
00:36:58,110 --> 00:36:58,670
Thank you for your hard work.

794
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,670
We've all worked hard today.

795
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,440
Good for us.

796
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,000
Come on, drink up.

797
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,070
Come on, let's have a drink.

798
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,480
Let's drink together. Come on.

799
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,400
Drink it.

800
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,230
Later,

801
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,440
Lu Yue probably heard

802
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,840
A making fun of our team in the toilet.

803
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,030
What the hell is ZGDX?

804
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:16,510
The players look so arrogant.

805
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,670
That's right.

806
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,230
Especially the one called Lu Yue,

807
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,550
what's he so arrogant about?

808
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:24,000
He's the one who got into the team
because of Lu Sicheng, right?

809
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,590
He is Lu Sicheng's brother.

810
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,920
Lu's family is too aggressive.

811
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,630
It's okay to be
a little bit proud in the game.

812
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,920
His brother didn't even
come to the party tonight.

813
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,920
And he still dared to shout at us.

814
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,920
They didn't show you any respect, A.

815
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:41,110
A, you must not let them off the hook.

816
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,070
We have to deal them a little something.

817
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,670
He's just like his brother,
unbeknownst to praise.

818
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,590
How dare he not show respect to our A?

819
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,800
What the hell.

820
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,320
Lu Yue.

821
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,110
- A.
- A.

822
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,000
Ming.

823
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,840
Ming.

824
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,360
Ming.

825
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,710
Stop it!

826
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,880
I'm calling the police.

827
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,670
- Let's go, A.
- Ming.

828
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:12,630
Go.

829
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,710
- Go.
- Just go.

830
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,400
Let's go.

831
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,150
It really has come to this.

832
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,880
Ming is still justifying Lu Yue.

833
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,110
He said that A's words
were too harsh at the time.

834
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,880
Even a sober person
couldn't have accepted it,

835
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,710
not to mention the drunk Lu Yue.

836
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:38,880
He also said that

837
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,360
Lu Yue never wanted to hear others say

838
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,400
he got into the team because of Cheng.

839
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,030
But what I don't understand is

840
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,510
if Lu Yue didn't want to

841
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,510
hear it,

842
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,110
then prove it by his skills.

843
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,590
He joined the fight
after hearing some harsh words.

844
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,550
What was that?

845
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,710
Just because of some harsh words,

846
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,670
he got into the fight
and dragged Ming into it.

847
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,670
Why should Ming suffer

848
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,150
from the conflict between him and A?

849
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,280
Ming shouldn't retire so early.

850
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:05,480
What a price we've suffered

851
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,960
because of Lu Yue's impulsiveness?

852
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,590
Hasn't anyone thought about it?

853
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:15,920
(- Hey, Yao.)
- Jinyang.

854
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,320
(- I know).
- I'll call you back.

855
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,880
(Don't hang up, Yao!)

856
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,800
(Go watch Ai Jia's live streaming.)

857
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,360
(He's trying to help Lu Yue clarify online.)

858
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,550
Clarify?

859
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:27,230
Jinyang said we should go watch
the live streaming.
