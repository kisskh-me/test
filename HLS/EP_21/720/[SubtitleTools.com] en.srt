00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,190
Goodness, that girl.

168
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,740
It looks like
she's not ready to say goodbye.

169
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,640
Should I help her out?

170
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,810
So his pet name is sir, right? Sir.

171
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,970
[Miss Dam]

172
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:28,100
[Sir, can you come right now?]

173
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:39,280
I sent him the address,
so if he isn't over her, he'll come.

174
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,570
Professor Shin?

175
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,010
Professor Shin! What brings you here?

176
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,780
Well, I...

177
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,680
I rarely come to a place like this,

178
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,840
but my friend broke up
with her boyfriend today.

179
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,300
She was having such a hard time,
so I sent him a text message,

180
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,750
and now I'm waiting for him.

181
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,340
I want them to get back together.

182
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,690
I see. So that's what.

183
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,330
Anyway, this is new.

184
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,620
You don't seem like the type
who'd be at a club.

185
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,630
Now that we're here,

186
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:34,060
why don't we dance to the rhythm?

187
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,960
Why? Professor, you should stay.

188
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,440
Instead of History 101,
let's do Dance 101...

189
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:56,280
Man, why isn't Dam's ex texting back?

190
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,610
He's done with her for good.

191
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,310
Dam.

192
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,580
Let's go dance.

193
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:07,280
You can completely forget
about your ex-boyfriend.

194
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,860
Okay? Let's go.

195
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,490
Let's go.

196
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,970
Goodness, why can't I push this?

197
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,260
Be careful.

198
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,630
Thank you.

199
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,720
That could've been bad.

200
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,240
Sir.

201
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,140
Why are you here?

202
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:07,840
Because you were crying.

203
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,230
No matter how much I like you,

204
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,310
we have to stop here, right?

205
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,130
Our relationship

206
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:26,450
is putting other people in danger
as well as us.

207
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,090
Then we should stop here.

208
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,080
Why didn't you just ask me for help?

209
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,380
How could I?

210
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,309
I know how much pain I could put you in

211
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,650
better than anyone else.

212
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,640
I'm sorry

213
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:12,210
for liking you.

214
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,170
Dam.

215
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,500
You need to wake up.
You have an early class.

216
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,560
Hey.

217
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,630
How did I get home last night?

218
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,310
What do you think? You came home wasted.

219
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:14,030
You blacked out again?

220
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,800
You shouldn't drink so much.

221
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,950
Come out. I made some bean sprout soup.

222
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,160
Was that a dream?

223
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,540
Drink this. You don't look too well.

224
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,340
Are you okay?

225
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,100
Seon-woo.

226
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,260
Could you keep what happened

227
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,030
between Professor Shin and me a secret?

228
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:16,280
Things are already tough,

229
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:19,800
so I don't think
I could deal with all kinds of rumors.

230
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,140
I won't tell anyone.

231
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,260
You didn't have to ask me.

232
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,380
Thank you.

233
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,710
It would've been better

234
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,490
if he was a good guy.

235
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,770
If he was such a good man
who was way out of my league,

236
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,820
I think I could've given up.

237
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,820
What are you going to do?

238
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,380
We need to talk.

239
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,970
Have you met with Dam?

240
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,170
She can't seem to understand you?

241
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,460
I have no idea what to do.

242
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,440
Woo-yeo.

243
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:27,560
What do you think
Dam wants the most right now?

244
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,850
A breakup?

245
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,290
What are you talking about?
You two are over already.

246
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,720
Do you think
she'd be scared of you at this point?

247
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,270
She's not afraid she'll fall into danger.

248
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,570
She's afraid
you're putting other people in danger.

249
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:52,470
Well, I did tell you
that you should try using someone else,

250
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,370
but I haven't thought
of how she would feel.

251
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,640
She's human,
so she wouldn't understand this situation.

252
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:03,330
So if you want to be loved by a human,

253
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:06,460
shouldn't you show her how humane you are?

254
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,770
Now, look. Let's say you were driving.

255
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:18,380
Dam is standing on this side,

256
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,850
and there are five people
on the other side.

257
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:24,540
If the brake gives out and you have
no choice but to hit one of the two,

258
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:27,010
-what would you do?
-I'd hit the five.

259
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:29,470
What if one of them is pregnant?

260
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,190
-I don't care.
-What if there's a kid?

261
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:33,560
-I don't care.
-What if I'm there?

262
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,500
I don't care.

263
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,540
[How do I turn this guy into a human?]

264
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,630
[Would she be better off with Seon-woo,
with the red thread and all?]

265
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:50,500
[Wait, Seon-woo is
as less of a human as him anyway.]

266
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,530
[A beast who couldn't become human]

267
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,470
[A man who's worse than a beast]

268
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,700
[Then the question is]

269
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,520
[which one of them will
become a decent human first.]

270
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:59,390
[Who'll become a decent human first?]

271
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,040
[To be honest,
this is a pretty fair game.]

272
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,220
Are you saying I'm wrong?

273
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:06,390
Then is it right for me to save
those strangers over Miss Dam?

274
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,310
That's not what I meant,
but I thought you'd hesitate a little.

275
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,150
Why should I?

276
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,010
That's what humans are like,

277
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,390
and I'm sure
that's what she wants from you.

278
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:44,800
Dam, goodness, you reek of alcohol.

279
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,950
How much did you have to drink?

280
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,350
Let's go relieve our hangover.
I'll buy you soup.

281
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,550
Hey, Hye-sun.

282
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:56,060
-Let's go.
-I...

283
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,010
I heard Woo-yeo cheated on you.

284
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,460
So you dumped him coldly.

285
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:11,020
I mean, as you know,
he didn't exactly cheat on me...

286
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,340
Don't take his side.

287
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,850
You two are over,
so you don't have to cover for him.

288
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:20,830
I can't just be a stranger right away.
My feelings are the same.

289
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,790
At first, I couldn't believe what he did.

290
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:29,240
But then I kind of understood,
yet I still can't.

291
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,320
I feel like such a fool.

292
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,310
It's not your fault.

293
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,740
But it's not Woo-yeo's fault either.

294
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,200
I don't know what you were expecting,

295
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,780
but he's a fox.

296
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:50,400
That means he could've deceived you
much better if he wanted to.

297
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:54,450
He wouldn't have told you
about that red thread

298
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:56,210
or how he had been

299
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,800
taking your energy
even though he had the Marble.

300
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,300
And those rumors?

301
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,910
It wouldn't have been difficult
for him to get rid of the rumors.

302
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,530
He could've done better in deceiving you.

303
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,170
But he didn't.

304
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,910
He's not human.

305
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,650
But when it comes to you,

306
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,500
he could be humane.

307
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,630
I know that, but...

308
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,790
His Marble is starting to turn blue.

309
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,690
Why is it turning blue?

310
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,010
You didn't know?

311
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:34,220
Once his Marble turns blue
instead of red by human energy,

312
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,290
he can become human.

313
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,120
His Marble had been stagnant
for about 1,000 years,

314
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:43,860
but it suddenly turned blue twice
ever since he met you.

315
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,160
And this time, it remained in blue,

316
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,580
although it only changed halfway.

317
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:53,050
Are you saying
he could really become human?

318
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,550
Do you finally get

319
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:58,510
why Woo-yeo did something
so out of the ordinary?

320
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,900
Hye-sun, I should go see him.

321
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,130
I'm sorry.

322
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,160
Can we talk for a second?

323
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:42,290
I'm sorry.

324
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,220
I don't know everything
about what I need to do

325
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,390
to live as a human,

326
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,080
but if I made you cry,

it means I was wrong. No questions needed.

If it doesn't bother you

329
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,840
that I'm a fox, not human,

330
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,970
then I'll stay this way.

331

To me,

00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,650
this relationship isn't
something I can simply let go.

333
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:26,160
Then that's the more reason
you should've held me back.

it should be me, nobody else.

00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,340
This is so random.

489
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,720
Is that necessary?

490
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,270
Think about the pattern in his behavior.

491
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,000
When you drift away from him,
he tries to catch you.

492
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,370
But when you try to catch him,
he runs away.

493
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,880
So if you really want to catch him,

494
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,730
let him go first.

495
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,680
I'm sure even a mere impression
of doing that

496
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,000
would drive him crazy.

497
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,220
I'm not sure. I don't want to do that.

498
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,550
The situation is not so good.

499
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,420
I can't tell you the details,

500
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:53,880
but I can tell you one thing for sure.
That attitude is not going to help.

501
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,960
I've seen him for over 700 years.

502
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,370
So trust me.

503
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,020
He needs to be pushed.

504
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,300
To deal with a fox,

505
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,850
you have to be a fox yourself.

506
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,910
Don't be too nice to me.

507
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,520
This is why you get hurt when it's over.

508
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,850
Did she say that

509
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,840
because she likes someone else?

510
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,750
Hey.

511
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,610
I could use some alcohol today. You in?

512
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,980
I know you're busy
hanging out with Hye-sun lately,

513
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,300
but just for today...

514
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,850
Actually, I could use some alcohol too.

515
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:03,050
What happened here?

516
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:06,390
Let's go grab a drink.

517
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,500
-Never mind. See you later.
-Dam.

518
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:17,130
Are you not going to ask me what happened?

519
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,800
Do I have to?

520
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:21,090
I'm not doing so great myself.

521
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:23,370
Why is that?

522
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:25,660
Did something happen with your boyfriend?

523
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,250
Don't ask me.

524
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,910
I want you to ask me.

525
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:37,500
You're really annoying. What happened?

526
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,970
I am

527
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,190
falling in love with Hye-sun.

528
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,970
I knew it. You helpless romance addict.

529
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:50,480
And where's the problem?

530
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:54,790
I think we should break up.

531
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:57,390
It turns out

532
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,510
that Hye-sun likes someone else.

533
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:02,530
Are you sure?

534
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,430
Seeing how she took care of you

535
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:06,270
at the festival afterparty

536
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,390
and the way she looks at you these days,

537
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:10,280
I thought she had feelings for you.

538
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:12,870
No. I think Hye-sun

539
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,130
likes Professor Shin.

540
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,900
What? I don't think that's the case.

541
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:23,390
Why? Because Professor Shin
is going out with Professor Seo?

542
00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:24,970
No, that's not why.

543
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,170
Anyway, it's not true.

544
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,150
What do you know?

545
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:32,370
I know, you punk. Just drink.

546
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,170
You don't know anything.

547
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:39,670
-Gosh.
-One stir-fried cartilage and soju please.

548
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,470
-Okay.
-It's so annoying.

549
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,010
My ex keeps texting me.

550
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,910
Why, all of a sudden?

551
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:47,460
-You know my old friend, Hyeon-cheol.
-Gosh, it's bitter.

552
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:50,710
After I posted a photo of us,
he texted me and asked what we were,

553
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:55,910
saying that seeing me with another man
made him realize how he feels about me.

554
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:02,550
-Goodness.
-Sorry.

555
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,550
What are you doing?

556
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,840
That was so relatable.

557
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,910
It's like the universe
has given us the answer.

558
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:14,340
You don't want to break up
with Hye-sun, do you?

559
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,420
Of course not. Why do you ask?

560
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,930
I just came up with a brilliant idea.

[of doing that would drive him crazy.]

563
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:30,530
To deal with a fox,
you have to be a fox yourself.

564
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:34,100
From now on, I'll be a fox too.

565
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,380

So you're saying
I should make her jealous.

Yes. Who knows?

591
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:24,580
The jealousy might help her realize
her feelings for you.

I'm not sure if she even has
feelings for me.

Then tell her it was my idea
and you'd never see me again.

I won't just tell her that.
