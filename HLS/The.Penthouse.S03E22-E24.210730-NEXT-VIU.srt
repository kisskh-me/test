1
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:10,694
Previously on The Penthouse 3.

2
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:13,864
I'm so moved!

3
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:17,879
Education will be used in their ploy to make money on real estate.

4
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:20,350
Dohae Construction won the Cheonsoo contract.

5
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,780
Arrange a meeting with Dohae's CEO.

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,250
Give me the construction rights.

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,345
I won't.

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,614
I swear I will step on Ha Eun Byeol and become the best.

9
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:30,859
I'll be a prima donna for Clark's performance?

10
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:32,189
If you trust my ears,

11
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:34,254
please give her one more chance.

12
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:36,399
Who are you?

13
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,259
What's your relationship with Logan?

14
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:40,329
Just keep him alive.

15
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:42,600
Logan's body's value changes drastically...

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,740
based on whether or not he's alive.

17
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,009
You are the only person our family can trust.

18
00:00:47,009 --> 00:00:48,735
This belongs to Ms. Oh Yoon Hee, right?

19
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:50,240
The watch was able to record sounds.

20
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,109
Seok Kyung is your biological daughter.

21
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:55,509
Seok Kyung is Seol A's twin sister.

22
00:00:55,509 --> 00:00:57,214
Seok Kyung is my daughter?

23
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:01,245
(Episode 8)

24
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,355
Seok Hoon!

25
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:16,595
When did you last hear from Seok Kyung?

26
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,500
She said she arrived safely yesterday. Why?

27
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,969
Do you know the name of the school in Italy? Where is it?

28
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:23,609
Did she say anything else to you?

29
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:24,680
Can you reach any of her friends?

30
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,579
She tells you everything.

31
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:28,304
Calm down and tell me what's going on.

32
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,875
Did something happen to Seok Kyung?

33
00:01:31,219 --> 00:01:36,114
I had twins in the US.

34
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,414
I gave birth prematurely from shock,

35
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,454
and I was told one twin died right after birth. But apparently,

36
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:45,954
she is alive.

37
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,064
What do you mean?

38
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:50,965
Seol A's twin sister is...

39
00:01:53,109 --> 00:01:54,435
Seok Kyung.

40
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,534
What?

41
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,974
Seok Kyung and Seol A are twins?

42
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:06,914
Do you mean Seok Kyung and I are not biological siblings?

43
00:02:07,949 --> 00:02:10,460
He switched Seol A with Hye In right after birth,

44
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,414
so I couldn't meet her all my life.

45
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,860
And he lied to me that Seok Kyung was stillborn...

46
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,794
and raised her himself.

47
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,729
It's your father's doing. He's behind all this.

48
00:02:20,729 --> 00:02:23,534
Why would he do that? For what?

49
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,734
He must have wanted to torment me.

50
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:30,974
He told Seok Kyung that I wasn't her biological mother...

51
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,805
to turn her against me.

52
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:36,409
Now he'll use the fact that she's my daughter...

53
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:37,944
to blackmail me.

54
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:41,514
Then why did he send Seok Kyung abroad to study?

55
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,085
I don't know.

56
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:47,585
I'm afraid that's not what happened.

57
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,384
I have a bad feeling.

58
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,659
That can't be right.

59
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:53,930
She even sent me some pictures yesterday.

60
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,500
Pictures of her at the airport...

61
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,435
and on campus.

62
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:04,734
This is fake. It's been manipulated. Look here.

63
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,504
You don't see her shadow.

64
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,014
Then...

65
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,414
what do you think happened to Seok Kyung?

66
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:29,465
Who are you guys?

67
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,340
Am I in Italy?

68
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,439
What is this girl saying? Italy?

69
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,840
- Italy? - What?

70
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,610
What are you guys doing?

71
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,104
Bring the person in charge.

72
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,979
What a bunch of lowlifes.

73
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:42,810
Did you guys kidnap me or something?

74
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,620
Do you know who my dad is?

75
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,014
Is something wrong with your tongue?

76
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:49,414
What's with the way you talk?

77
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,984
(A clean body, a pure soul)

78
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,264
Don't come any closer.

79
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:07,740
Lay a finger on me,

80
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,405
and I'll kill you all.

81
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:11,705
Don't come any closer.

82
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:14,275
Stay away from me!

83
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,005
Stay away!

84
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,215
(Motto: Kindness, truth, action, and patience)

85
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,025
Logan, can you hear me?

86
00:04:34,569 --> 00:04:36,695
Move your fingers if you can hear me.

87
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,294
I'm Ha Yoon Chul. You can trust me.

88
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:54,984
Can you bring Su Ryeon to me?

89
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,224
Logan, are you okay? Can you hear me?

90
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,484
Yes.

91
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,265
Su Ryeon...

92
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,565
How is she?

93
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:15,835
Don't worry. She's safe.

94
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:18,174
How long...

95
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:22,304
has it been?

96
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:25,945
It's been seven months since the accident.

97
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:29,145
Do you know who did this to you?

98
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,255
Joo Dan Tae.

99
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:34,025
It's his doing.

100
00:05:35,389 --> 00:05:40,325
I saw him clearly at the scene.

101
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:42,895
I knew it was his doing.

102
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,104
Please get me out of here right now.

103
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,575
Su Ryeon may be in danger.

104
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:56,445
I need to call my brother, Alex.

105
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,744
I need to call him...

106
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,044
and let him know I'm alive.

107
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:14,494
What happened? Did he wake up?

108
00:06:14,829 --> 00:06:17,465
I think I just saw him move.

109
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,604
Don't tell me he's conscious.

110
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:27,804
He must be experiencing delirium.

111
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:29,509
He's talking nonsense, and his condition is bad.

112
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:31,345
He might not get through the night.

113
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,015
Are you saying he might die?

114
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:41,124
You're dead if you're lying.

115
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,255
I don't care about him enough to give up my life for him!

116
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,924
We don't have much time.

117
00:06:48,069 --> 00:06:49,794
I don't think he'll make it through the night.

118
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,534
Then we can't wait any longer.

119
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,145
It's time to make my move.

120
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,955
Mom.

121
00:07:13,589 --> 00:07:15,354
How is it there?

122
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,335
There's no one harassing you...

123
00:07:24,899 --> 00:07:26,864
and hating on you, right?

124
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,864
You're at peace, right?

125
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:35,405
I'm happy if you're happy.

126
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,965
I miss you...

127
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,294
so very much.

128
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:15,784
The one pulling the strings behind Dohae Construction...

129
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,715
was Su Ryeon.

130
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:21,724
Su Ryeon was the lobbyist?

131
00:08:21,829 --> 00:08:22,930
How is that possible?

132
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:25,560
They called her "Madam Na," so I thought she was a bar madam.

133
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,764
Who could've imagined Su Ryeon would do that?

134
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,100
She has done much worse.

135
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,705
Why couldn't you imagine it?

136
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:36,269
Who else would mess with us like that?

137
00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:39,104
What's the point in arguing about that now?

138
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,450
We need to get the development rights to Cheonsoo District.

139
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,519
Cheong A Constructions is about to go bankrupt otherwise.

140
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:46,679
You moron. Why did you do something to make it go bankrupt?

141
00:08:46,679 --> 00:08:48,990
Why is it always my fault if things go wrong?

142
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,154
You have no right to get angry.

143
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,514
Darn it.

144
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:56,754
Hold on.

145
00:08:58,059 --> 00:08:59,754
Madam Na?

146
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:04,364
Do you know the bar...

147
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,364
where Su Ryeon used to work?

148
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,234
There's no record of her leaving the country?

149
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:12,634
Are you sure?

150
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,345
Okay. I'll be in touch.

151
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,815
There's no record of her leaving?

152
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,049
Then where is she?

153
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:24,285
I think he took her somewhere else.

154
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,384
Somewhere where he can control her.

155
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,158
Forget this. I need to go and ask.

156
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,354
No.

157
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,465
You'll put her in danger if you say something.

158
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,624
If Seok Kyung really is my daughter,

159
00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:39,435
there's nothing Dan Tae won't do.

160
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:41,705
He will not go easy on her.

161
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,404
What if... Like Seol A...

162
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:48,149
I promise I'll find her.

163
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:49,805
I'll do whatever it takes.

164
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,679
Father trusts me right now.

165
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:54,685
I'll go to work tomorrow and locate Seok Kyung.

166
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,960
I'm sure I'll find a lead if I tail Secretary Cho.

167
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,654
Seok Hoon. I'm scared.

168
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:04,024
Seok Kyung is my sister.

169
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,595
I will protect my sister.

170
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,354
Give it up.

171
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:41,264
They have to open it from the outside.

172
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:43,940
What?

173
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,570
There were too many girls like you who tried to run away.

174
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,805
I have to get out of here. And I will.

175
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:53,009
My mom will find me soon.

176
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:55,049
My big brother will make you all pay.

177
00:10:55,049 --> 00:10:56,580
You're all dead.

178
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,345
What garbage.

179
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,750
This place is for orphans.

180
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:03,114
Orphans who were dumped by our parents.

181
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,159
Just like you.

182
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:08,024
An orphan? Why am I an orphan?

183
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,059
No one looks for us, and even if they do,

184
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:11,555
they can't find us.

185
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:13,965
This place isn't on any map.

186
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:16,029
- Quiet. - Seriously.

187
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:18,740
- Pipe down. - Enough already.

188
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,535
- Let's get some sleep. - What's her problem?

189
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,205
Let me out.

190
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:27,244
Let me out!

191
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:31,049
Let me out, you jerks!

192
00:11:31,049 --> 00:11:33,220
- What's wrong with you? - Stop it.

193
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,585
Quiet.

194
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,215
- Stop it. - Quiet.

195
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,884
Let's get some sleep.

196
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:42,925
Stop it!

197
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:45,529
- What's wrong with you? - Darn it.

198
00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:46,929
Cut it out.

199
00:11:46,929 --> 00:11:49,199
You're not the only one here.

200
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,394
Think about other people.

201
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,134
Keep it down.

202
00:12:12,289 --> 00:12:13,289
Hello.

203
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:15,659
Why are you here so late? Pick up the pace.

204
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:17,798
It's only 6am, okay?

205
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:19,700
I didn't get up this early even when I was a high school senior.

206
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,524
Keep talking back to me, and I'll break your teeth.

207
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,898
Report.

208
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:26,370
Yoo Jenny's recent activities.

209
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,470
She's studying hard.

210
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,870
She has tteokbokki and chicken once a day.

211
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,309
She studies at night in the community room.

212
00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:32,409
She's mad busy preparing for the Cheong A Arts Center audition.

213
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:35,705
Also, I took this picture.

214
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,715
My gosh. My daughter.

215
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:41,685
She got prettier.

216
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:45,159
Is she still getting along with Ro Na?

217
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:46,289
Don't they ever fight?

218
00:12:46,289 --> 00:12:48,785
They're besties. They even live together.

219
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,825
Give this to her.

220
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:58,899
Tell her you got them for her to wear to her audition.

221
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:00,805
Tell her I got them for her again?

222
00:13:00,909 --> 00:13:02,610
She won't accept them then.

223
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,210
She doesn't like me.

224
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,604
You know what I did to her.

225
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,309
You should give them to her.

226
00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:11,220
I don't know what you did wrong,

227
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,820
but I'm sure it's not as bad as what I did.

228
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,085
Pick them up now.

229
00:13:16,289 --> 00:13:19,884
If Jenny isn't wearing these at her audition, you're dead.

230
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,129
Yes, sir.

231
00:13:21,129 --> 00:13:23,585
Take a picture of her wearing them and show it to me.

232
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:28,095
Keep your mouth shut. Got that?

233
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,494
You may go.

234
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:33,264
Why did you make me come here so early in the morning?

235
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,764
What is it this time?

236
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,805
I have a gift.

237
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,309
I got them for you to wear to your audition.

238
00:13:41,309 --> 00:13:42,445
Whatever.

239
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,250
These are the newest design from my favorite brand.

240
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,915
They're so pretty.

241
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,384
Is that what you expected?

242
00:13:54,789 --> 00:13:56,455
I don't want them. Return them.

243
00:13:56,659 --> 00:13:59,654
Wait. No. You have to wear them.

244
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,925
I may die if you don't.

245
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,795
What do you mean?

246
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,234
Well, so...

247
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,904
I may die of a broken heart.

248
00:14:10,909 --> 00:14:12,634
Did you decide to become my stalker?

249
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:14,879
Why are you following me around and being weird?

250
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:16,974
Who cares if I'm being weird?

251
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:20,545
Just be cool about it and take them. Please.

252
00:14:22,289 --> 00:14:24,585
- I'll just try them on. - Okay.

253
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:31,425
Hey.

254
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:35,624
They're prettier than I expected.

255
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,778
Mission complete.

256
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:47,404
Who are you sending that to?

257
00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:49,675
No. Wait!

258
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,644
- Hand it over. - No.

259
00:14:53,379 --> 00:14:55,720
Well... So...

260
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,415
So that's what it was.

261
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,154
My dad made you do it.

262
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:08,299
Mr. Chairman.

263
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:09,600
There's a problem among the subcontractors...

264
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,240
regarding the contractor selection matter.

265
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,065
You should meet with them...

266
00:15:15,139 --> 00:15:17,165
Must I worry about things like that too?

267
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:19,940
I made you the CEO of Cheong A Construction!

268
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:22,404
You should take care of it so these things don't happen!

269
00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:24,075
I'm sorry, sir.

270
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,514
Have a nice day.

271

Jenny.

272
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,669
Were you buying me this garbage...

273
00:15:43,669 --> 00:15:46,335
with money you made from bowing to and getting kicked by that rat?

274
00:15:47,139 --> 00:15:48,965
I don't need this garbage.

275
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:52,809
And I don't need you.

276
00:15:52,809 --> 00:15:54,805
Don't make Min Hyuk do that anymore.

I'm doing this for you.

281
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:17,124
Can you come to the airport?

282
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,364
I haven't seen you in so long.

283
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:21,909
And I won't be seeing you for a while.

284
00:16:21,909 --> 00:16:23,940
Why do you need me when you'll do whatever you want?

285
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,710
Don't call me whether you live or die.

I can pretend I don't have a sister.

Bye.

00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:36,785
Why didn't I notice? I'm such an idiot.

289

Hang in there for a while.

I'll do as you said and learn the ropes.

I wonder why my son suddenly decided to be obedient.

294

00:31:41,889 --> 00:31:43,120
What about SNU?

502
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,285
That school where shortcuts work?

503
00:31:46,889 --> 00:31:49,525
What shortcuts are you referring to?

504
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:55,124
("Libiamo ne' lieti calici")

505
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,795
("Libiamo ne' lieti calici")

506
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,570
Even before the audition started,

507
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:06,174
you were warming up to "Libiamo ne' lieti calici."

508
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:08,645
If this isn't a shortcut, what is?

509
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:11,275
Your mom told you beforehand!

510
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:15,088
You're the one who should be disqualified, not us.

511
00:32:15,089 --> 00:32:16,744
Every person here...

512
00:32:17,289 --> 00:32:20,254
has lost the chance to win because of you.

513
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:24,595
Is there any reason for us to audition fair and square?

514
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,295
What do you think, Ha Eun Byeol?

515
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,765
Don't feel too sorry for yourself.

516
00:32:32,969 --> 00:32:35,265
It's something you've always done.

517
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:43,645
(First prize)

518
00:32:47,219 --> 00:32:48,845
(Cheong A Arts Center Artist in Residence Audition)

519
00:33:08,539 --> 00:33:10,564
Smile, ma'am.

520
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:14,105
They can clearly see that you don't want to give this to me.

521
00:33:20,849 --> 00:33:23,715
Look here!

522
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:30,655
Congratulations, Ro Na!

523
00:33:33,829 --> 00:33:35,624
Over here!

524
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:54,574
Bae Ro Na, how dare you mock me?

525
00:33:54,749 --> 00:33:56,849
Thank you for being a judge today.

526
00:33:56,849 --> 00:33:59,415
No worries at all. It's been fun.

527
00:33:59,989 --> 00:34:02,429
These kids were so good...

528
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:06,224
that I am now considering retiring.

529
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:10,329
Thank you.

530
00:34:10,329 --> 00:34:12,899
The audition went smoothly thanks to you.

531
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,270
I didn't need to do much...

532
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,265
because she was exceptional.

533
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:19,509
The most important thing...

534
00:34:19,509 --> 00:34:20,780
is to set fair standards.

535
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:23,150
I have no doubt Bae Ro Na...

536
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,214
will be a world-class prima donna.

537
00:34:25,650 --> 00:34:28,184
She totally changed the audition's vibe.

538
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:32,390
I had a great time thanks to you.

539
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:34,985
I hope to see you again next time under even better circumstances.

540
00:34:35,129 --> 00:34:37,759
You have to accept my invitation next time as well, promise?

541
00:34:37,759 --> 00:34:39,554
Of course. It's you.

542
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:47,099
I see. Call me as soon as you locate him.

543
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:48,310
I'll be waiting.

544
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:51,035
I see you're almost considering adopting Ro Na.

545
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,474
Instead of Min Seol A.

546
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:57,450
You were the one who invited Clark, Shim Su Ryeon?

547
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:59,974
Did you also sign Ro Na up for this audition?

548
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,684
That's quite low...

549
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:04,344
for Shim Su Ryeon.

550
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:07,985
What are you accusing me of?

551
00:35:08,129 --> 00:35:09,759
It was the kids' self-defense...

552
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:11,900
to protect the very basic idea of fairness.

553
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,160
Lies.

554
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,270
You think I don't know you were behind all this?

555
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,665
How much longer do you think this will last?

556
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:20,365
Right back at you.

557
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,905
You're really going crazy trying to regain the Cheong A Foundation.

558
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,310
You were the one...

559
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,839
who shook the board, weren't you?

560
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,348
It's true that you worked as a madam at a bar.

561
00:35:30,349 --> 00:35:32,245
I only revealed the truth.

562
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:35,985
Truth.

563
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:37,844
You love that, don't you?

564
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,854
Madam Na, right?

565
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,084
You even deleted all the CCTV footage.

566
00:35:44,259 --> 00:35:45,525
That's very meticulous.

567
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,125
I learned it from you.

568
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,564
Destruction of evidence.

569
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,569
You must want Cheong A Foundation back,

570
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:55,005
but it's not going to be easy.

571
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,005
I'm not planning on giving it back to you.

572
00:36:01,009 --> 00:36:03,375
If only you had left the foundation alone,

573
00:36:04,209 --> 00:36:06,314
we wouldn't have ended up here.

574
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:09,314
You don't have the right.

575
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:12,119
You're still cooking up secret plans.

576
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:13,854
You shouldn't get involved in education.

577
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,430
You don't even own any shares. Who are you to say that?

578
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:22,094
Are you counting on your dead ex's shares?

579
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:27,334
This doesn't concern your kids. Stay out of it.

580
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,035
I'll make sure...

581
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,604
you regret what happened today, Shim Su Ryeon.

582
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:45,184
Let's toast.

583
00:36:45,589 --> 00:36:47,515
To Ro Na.

584
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:48,690
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

585
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:49,954
Thank you.

586
00:36:51,829 --> 00:36:54,194
Look how shiny the trophy is.

587
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:58,025
Are you expecting a call? You've been staring at your phone.

588
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,440
It's nothing.

589
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,869
You should've seen Ms. Cheon's face earlier.

590
00:37:02,869 --> 00:37:04,709
So what if she disagrees?

591
00:37:04,709 --> 00:37:06,834
Ro Na was by far the best.

592
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,204
The reporters were all over her afterward.

593
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,349
Great job, Ro Na. Your mom must be so proud.

594
00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:14,844
This is just the beginning.

595
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:17,050
I'll make sure my skills are recognized.

596
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,785
You're one ambitious girl.

597
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:21,430
Your high notes in the finale gave me goosebumps.

598
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:23,628
You were just as good.

599
00:37:23,629 --> 00:37:24,724
Are you sure?

600
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,824
Are more people coming?

601
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:31,265
Should we try this?

602
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,635
- Surprise! - Here comes excellent champagne.

603
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:38,180
What brings you here? You're not invited.

604
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,810
We all worked hard.

605
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:42,509
How could you leave us out? I'm hurt.

606
00:37:42,509 --> 00:37:43,509
Welcome.

607
00:37:43,509 --> 00:37:46,219
Jenny, I was holding my breath earlier.

608
00:37:46,219 --> 00:37:48,150
You were just as good as Eun Byeol.

609
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,645
It really was the best part of the audition.

610
00:37:51,089 --> 00:37:53,255
- I was always that good. - I know that.

611
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,385
Why did you bring flowers? It's old-fashioned.

612
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:00,629
Su Ryeon, these skincare products are amazing.

613
00:38:00,629 --> 00:38:02,700
I thought they'd be perfect for you,

614
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,400
so I brought them for you.

615
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,995
- Thank you. - Oh, my.

616
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:09,410
It has red ginseng in it? What about me?

617
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:11,604
There's some for you too, of course.

618
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:14,135
- Where? - At my place.

619
00:38:14,479 --> 00:38:16,704
Forget it. Get out of here.

620
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:20,379
I prepared a gift for you too, I promise.

621
00:38:20,379 --> 00:38:22,719
Please let me stay.

622
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:24,390
- I'll go get it later. - It smells so nice.

623
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:26,719
- Please let me stay. - Hold on.

624
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:28,785
- Let's see here. - Come on.

625
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,025
It feels so nice.

626
00:38:33,129 --> 00:38:35,499
Su Ryeon, thank you for this.

627
00:38:35,499 --> 00:38:37,430
Please let me stay.

628
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,995
I want to celebrate with you.

629
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,765
This erases memories?

630
00:38:42,369 --> 00:38:46,434
Eun Byeol must know something about my mom's accident.

631
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:48,974
That's why she's taking this.

632
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,405
I think so too.

633
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,619
But I heard the side effects of that drug were so severe...

634
00:38:53,619 --> 00:38:55,814
that the clinical trials were put on hold.

635
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,255
It can cause early onset dementia.

636
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,985
Ms. Jin seemed to really care about Eun Byeol.

637
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:05,930
How could she give a drug like this to Eun Byeol?

638
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,859
She tried to kidnap Eun Byeol.

639
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:09,564
She's obsessive.

640
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:11,265
You shouldn't trust her.

641
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,545
Hi, Seok Hoon.

642
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:30,314
Bae Ro Na. Did you really have to do that?

643
00:39:31,489 --> 00:39:34,714
You mean witch!

644
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:42,464
(From Bae Ro Na)

645
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,170
Meet me in the community room.

646
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:46,464
(From Bae Ro Na: Meet me in the community room.)

647
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:55,574
You want to show off some more? Is that why you called me here?

648
00:40:01,219 --> 00:40:04,515
Does your mom know that you're taking this drug?

649
00:40:09,459 --> 00:40:11,084
Why do you have that?

650
00:40:12,859 --> 00:40:15,369
It's just a tranquilizer I've been taking for a long time.

651
00:40:15,369 --> 00:40:17,324
I only take it when I'm extremely nervous.

652
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,165
Is that what Ms. Jin told you?

653
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,564
Did you believe her, you fool?

654
00:40:23,709 --> 00:40:26,739
When you said you didn't remember anything about my mom's death,

655
00:40:26,739 --> 00:40:28,574
I thought you were lying.

656
00:40:29,209 --> 00:40:33,314
But now I know that you really had no memory of it.

657
00:40:35,089 --> 00:40:38,314
This drug erases your memories.

658
00:40:38,989 --> 00:40:41,459
Taken long-term, it can cause early onset dementia.

659
00:40:41,459 --> 00:40:43,530
That's ridiculous.

660
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:46,295
Why would Ms. Jin give me such an awful drug?

661
00:40:46,629 --> 00:40:49,824
Are you losing your mind after your mom's death?

662
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,674
Don't bother me like this again.

663
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,574
Wake up, Eun Byeol.

664
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,745
You shouldn't take this drug.

Eun Byeol!

666
00:41:16,329 --> 00:41:19,594
Mr. Ha, it's me, Ro Na.

667
00:41:20,999 --> 00:41:24,365
I have something to tell you. Do you have a minute?

668
00:41:27,099 --> 00:41:28,964
Oh, no. It's getting late.

669
00:41:29,109 --> 00:41:31,434
I should go and cook for Kyu Jin.

670
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:35,444
He's been insisting that we have grilled eel today.

671
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:36,704
See you.

672
00:41:37,249 --> 00:41:38,415
Why would you...

673
00:41:38,879 --> 00:41:41,379
cook for that jerk day in day out?

674
00:41:41,379 --> 00:41:44,390
He can prepare a meal himself.

675
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:47,719
My cutie can't do that.

676
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:50,790
He can't even pour a glass of water for himself.

677
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:52,755
Don't get shocked.

678
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:56,530
You said your cutie can't even pour a glass of water for himself.

679
00:41:56,530 --> 00:42:00,365
Here's what he does when he goes out.

680
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:02,334
Watch this.

681
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:09,380
This is what the Hera Club guys do when they go out.

682
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:12,045
This is who Lee Kyu Jin really is.

683
00:42:12,219 --> 00:42:15,590
Do you really want to be at his beck and call...

684
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:18,489
for the rest of your life?

685
00:42:18,489 --> 00:42:20,715
When he does this behind your back?

686
00:42:22,029 --> 00:42:25,995
What happened to my dear Kyu Jin?

Do they expect me to eat this?

690
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:40,804
How can I possibly eat this?

691
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,304
I'm not some pig.

692
00:42:43,309 --> 00:42:44,775
Do you need more beatings?

693
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:48,545
Cut it out and eat what you're given.

694
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:53,114
You can stuff your face all you want.

695

- Are you crazy? - Let go!

697
00:43:18,819 --> 00:43:20,180
She's a total psycho.

698
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,775
It hurts!

699
00:43:24,489 --> 00:43:25,654
What are you doing?

700
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:27,814
Take her away.

701
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:30,624
Stand up. Come.

702
00:43:32,499 --> 00:43:34,400
Who started it?

703
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,495
Answer!

704
00:43:38,069 --> 00:43:39,735
Come here.

705
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:41,935
Come on.

Hey, what are you doing?

Hey!

708
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:50,505
Get her!

709
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:55,445
Stop there!

710
00:43:56,549 --> 00:43:58,215
Stop! Come here!

711
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,054

712
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:10,965

This road leads to a retreat center.

721

It's a dead end. So she must be there.

722

Let's go, Mom.

723
00:45:30,549 --> 00:45:32,479
You stay here. I'll go check.

It's dangerous if you go alone.

I'm not alone.

It'll be dangerous for you if Dan Tae sees you now.

He'll even question why you're at the company.

Wait here.

Why are you doing this to me?

730
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:30,904
I betrayed Mom and left home to help you.

731
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:33,235
So why did you lock me up here?

732
00:46:33,539 --> 00:46:35,134
Let me out right now.

733
00:46:35,479 --> 00:46:37,775
I did everything you asked, so why?

734
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,950
You're so loud. Shut your mouth already.

735
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:42,644
Tell me.

736
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:45,319
Why am I here instead of in Italy?

00:46:45,319 --> 00:46:48,015
Do you want to know why you're here?

Seok Kyung.

739
00:46:50,229 --> 00:46:51,725
You're a fake.

740
00:46:52,029 --> 00:46:55,295
You have that rat's dirty blood flowing in your veins.

741
00:46:55,499 --> 00:46:58,840
You should've realized when I gave the penthouse...

742
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,834
and Cheonsoo District only to Seok Hoon.

743
00:47:02,209 --> 00:47:05,109
It meant you were not my daughter.

00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:07,035
Are you that stupid?

00:47:07,279 --> 00:47:10,844
What... What are you talking about?

746
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:12,844

747
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:15,945

Don't say my son's name with that lunatic mouth.

750

You and Seok Hoon have different roots.

751
00:47:23,630 --> 00:47:27,894
You have the same dirty, lowly blood as Seol A.

Me?

756
00:47:36,539 --> 00:47:39,440
I took you in and fed you, clothed you, and let you enjoy...

757
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,239
the best life living in the penthouse.

758
00:47:41,239 --> 00:47:42,775
You have nothing to complain about.

759
00:47:42,779 --> 00:47:44,545
Stop lying to me!

No.

761
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:49,414
Why are you doing this to me, Dad?

762
00:47:49,489 --> 00:47:51,489
You have nowhere to go anymore.

763

You didn't even realize she was your mom.

You wouldn't have raised me if I were someone else's child.

Why would you raise Seol A's sister?

00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,445
I would've brought Seol A.

772

Okay, then. Earn your keep...

Tearfully beg your mom to save you.

To do everything you ask.

776
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:30,255
You can do that much, right?

Hello?

779
00:48:38,569 --> 00:48:41,235
Make Dohae Construction forfeit the development rights.

780
00:48:41,569 --> 00:48:43,265
Then everything will be beautiful.

781
00:48:43,610 --> 00:48:45,140
Why should I do that?

782
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:47,275
That's the only way your daughter will live.

783
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:50,245
Seok Kyung didn't go to Italy.

784
00:48:50,249 --> 00:48:52,374
I hid her somewhere.

785
00:48:52,779 --> 00:48:55,319
Do you not care if you never see your biological child ever again?

786
00:48:55,319 --> 00:48:56,719
Where's Seok Kyung?

787
00:48:56,719 --> 00:48:59,120
If you hurt her in any way, I'll kill you.

788
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,715
Don't get so worked up.

789
00:49:02,229 --> 00:49:04,384
Talk to your daughter.

790
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:06,894
I think your daughter has something to say.

791
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:12,995

792
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:15,705
Seok Kyung. Is that you?

793

Where are you?

794
00:49:17,509 --> 00:49:19,275
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

795
00:49:23,749 --> 00:49:25,144
Tell her.

796
00:49:25,410 --> 00:49:27,644
You wanted to talk to your mom.

797
00:49:30,019 --> 00:49:33,255
Tell her to hand over the development rights.

798
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:36,529
Tell her it's her daughter's desperate plea.

799
00:49:36,529 --> 00:49:39,959
Seok Kyung. I'm coming. I'll be right there.

800
00:49:39,959 --> 00:49:41,624
Hang in there, okay?

801
00:49:44,499 --> 00:49:46,295
You heard what Dad wants.

802
00:49:49,539 --> 00:49:51,404
Don't do any of it.

803
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:54,005
Don't do it because of me!

No. That can't be.

Why don't you try to be honest for once?

822
00:51:00,739 --> 00:51:02,279
Ro Na's mom is dead.

823
00:51:02,279 --> 00:51:04,445
Aren't you secretly pleased about it?

824
00:51:05,209 --> 00:51:09,285
That woman was punished for killing your daughter.

825
00:51:10,390 --> 00:51:12,259
Please stop pretending to be good...

826
00:51:12,259 --> 00:51:14,314
and show how you really feel.

827
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,989
I won't care anymore...

828
00:51:17,989 --> 00:51:20,824
how you live your life or what you do with your dad.

829
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:23,700
You're no longer my daughter.

830
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:25,795
Now you're showing your true colors.

831
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:29,404
It's not like you treated me like a daughter!

832
00:51:31,739 --> 00:51:33,880
I taught them as much as you paid me,

833
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,910
Seok Kyung was the one who was deceitful.

834
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:38,205
She even humiliated me and claimed I was a thief.

835
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:40,215
- Shut your mouth. - Seok Kyung.

836
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,819
How did you come in first place in the test then?

837
00:51:43,819 --> 00:51:46,255
I passed fair and square with my talent.

838
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:48,185
Is that wrong?

839
00:51:48,459 --> 00:51:51,590
Maybe you approached us on purpose to steal information.

840
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:55,195
There's no information I can take from you anyway.

841
00:51:56,499 --> 00:51:58,594
- Seok Kyung. - That was...

842
00:51:59,469 --> 00:52:00,600
What are you doing?

843
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,164
That's my warning telling you to know your place.

844
00:52:03,309 --> 00:52:05,064
Why? Are you angry?

845
00:52:07,009 --> 00:52:09,350
You idiot. I think the car is on fire.

846
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:11,975
Let's get out of here. What if the car explodes?

847
00:52:13,019 --> 00:52:14,374
Don't go!

848
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:16,344
Let me out!

849
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:26,394
No.

850
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:28,755
It can't be.

851
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,295
No.

852
00:52:31,529 --> 00:52:33,894
No!

853
00:52:34,469 --> 00:52:36,535
Liar!

854
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:11,664
(Sisters of Korea)

855
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:41,094
Stop them.

856
00:53:50,380 --> 00:53:51,844
Where's Seok Kyung?

857
00:53:53,049 --> 00:53:54,745
How did you find this place?

858
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:56,450
Did that witch tell you?

859
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:57,890
What did you do with her?

860
00:53:57,890 --> 00:53:59,985
What did you do to my daughter?

861
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,455
Your daughter?

862
00:54:01,719 --> 00:54:03,830
You knew she was your real daughter?

863
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:05,390
Whether or not she was my blood,

864
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:07,299
Seok Kyung was always my child.

865
00:54:07,299 --> 00:54:11,100
Right. Since I raised your daughter all this time,

866
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:14,394
give me the development rights as a thank you.

867
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,364
Did you raise her to do this garbage?

868
00:54:19,279 --> 00:54:22,644
I'll make sure you never touch her with those dirty hands again.

869
00:54:37,789 --> 00:54:38,985
Seok Kyung.

870
00:54:48,539 --> 00:54:49,705
Seok Kyung.

(Sisters of Korea)

872
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:04,384
(Mom, don't look for me anymore. I won't let Dad catch me.)

873
00:55:07,319 --> 00:55:09,584
Mom, don't look for me anymore.

874
00:55:09,989 --> 00:55:12,130
I won't let Dad catch me.

875
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:14,195
(Mom, don't look for me anymore. I won't let Dad catch me.)

876
00:55:14,959 --> 00:55:16,465
Seok Kyung.

(Sisters of Korea)

878
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:37,485
Seok Hoon, we're in trouble.

879
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:39,314
Seok Kyung's gone.

880
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:42,584
What do you mean? No one passed by me.

881
00:55:42,959 --> 00:55:44,285
I'll come over.

882
00:56:26,539 --> 00:56:27,968
I can't go back like this.

883
00:56:27,969 --> 00:56:29,965
I will correct everything myself.

884
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:38,604
Find her!

885
00:56:41,779 --> 00:56:43,084
Joo Seok Kyung.

886
00:56:44,749 --> 00:56:46,884
You're dead once I catch you.

887
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:51,414
- Place your bets. - Wow!

888
00:56:56,430 --> 00:56:57,625
Ace, all in.

889
00:56:57,929 --> 00:56:59,024
All in.

890
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:07,234
Ace, king, house.

891
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:08,665
Show your cards.

892
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:12,205
Kings, you win.

893
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:14,475
Darn it.

894
00:57:15,209 --> 00:57:16,315
Mister.

895
00:57:19,049 --> 00:57:21,415
Who's next?

896
00:57:25,089 --> 00:57:26,525
Hey, what's going on, man?

897
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:28,724
What are you doing here?

898
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:32,165
You remember me, right?

899
00:57:33,070 --> 00:57:35,025
Logan's brother Alex.

900
00:57:42,479 --> 00:57:44,305
You can't come here at this hour.

901
00:57:46,879 --> 00:57:49,214
Logan's brother visited me at the gambling den.

902
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:52,485
He knows I'm a gambler.

903
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:54,085
What?

904
00:57:54,449 --> 00:57:55,820
I told you to be careful for a while.

905
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:57,960
You can't let him find out something that important right now.

906
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:01,184
Why are you so slow to sort things out?

907
00:58:02,259 --> 00:58:03,725
Where is Logan right now?

908
00:58:04,759 --> 00:58:06,600
Hand him over to James,

909
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:10,135
get me the money I'm owed so I can leave.

910
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:12,635
No.

911
00:58:13,639 --> 00:58:16,535
I'll deal directly with James.

912
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:20,150
Once they suspect us, it's all over.

913
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:21,475
What excuse did you give?

914
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:23,874
That I dropped by for fun because I felt suffocated.

915
00:58:25,719 --> 00:58:27,385
He didn't seem to believe me.

916
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:31,214
Call James.

917
00:58:31,490 --> 00:58:32,885
He can have him tomorrow.

918
00:58:33,559 --> 00:58:34,654
Tomorrow?

919
00:58:36,229 --> 00:58:39,094
Give this to James. Say you found Logan.

920
00:58:43,339 --> 00:58:45,964
Tell him that Joo Dan Tae had kept Logan hidden away.

921
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:49,035
Will this be the end of Joo Dan Tae, then?

922
00:58:51,479 --> 00:58:53,645
Are you going to bury this doctor too?

923
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:56,650
He works for Dan Tae,

924
00:58:56,650 --> 00:58:58,515
so James will be convinced Dan Tae's behind it.

925
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:03,914
Very soon, you'll become incredibly rich.

926
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:06,555
Because I will give you half the reward.

927
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:11,254
Yes, this is it!

928
00:59:14,629 --> 00:59:17,594
It's time for everything to go back to its place.

929
00:59:35,219 --> 00:59:37,214
You did well so far, Logan.

930
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:40,425
In just 24 hours,

931
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:43,055
you will feel very comfortable.

932

(Cheong A Group)

933
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:03,015
You look like a right mess.

934
01:00:03,249 --> 01:00:05,819
Did it not go too well with Dohae Construction's lobbyist?

935
01:00:05,819 --> 01:00:07,189
Do not agitate me.

936
01:00:07,189 --> 01:00:09,955
You should've killed Su Ryeon when you had the chance.

937
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:12,020
Then we wouldn't have gone to prison...

938
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:14,525
or fail at everything we attempted.

939
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:16,700
It's all your fault.

940
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,395
It's my fault again?

941
01:00:18,629 --> 01:00:20,865
Can you stop blaming others?

942
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:23,664
I'm not here to fight.

943
01:00:24,339 --> 01:00:25,495
Shim Su Ryeon.

944
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:28,805
Why not leave her to me this time?

945
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:32,775
- What? - I'll get rid of her.

946
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,874
But I need your help in return.

947
01:00:36,349 --> 01:00:38,020
If you cooperate with me,

948
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:40,444
proof that you killed Logan...

949
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:42,684
will disappear forever.

950
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:44,615
How's that?

951
01:00:50,099 --> 01:00:51,925
What must I cooperate with?

952
01:00:53,069 --> 01:00:55,664
It's not a bad deal for you at all.

953
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,295
If you're lucky,

954
01:00:59,809 --> 01:01:03,305
you can also get rid of that pain Baek Jun Ki.

955
01:01:14,489 --> 01:01:17,014
Kyu Jin's hungry.

956
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:21,655
Where's your husband's breakfast?

957
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:26,495
Why are you drinking soju in the morning?

958
01:01:28,669 --> 01:01:29,764
There's no food?

959
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:36,774
Food.

960
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:47,485
What's this?

961
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:49,084
Where's Kyu Jin's?

962
01:01:49,489 --> 01:01:50,655
There's really nothing?

963
01:01:51,890 --> 01:01:55,460
From now on, whatever you put in your mouth,

964
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:58,225
you can prepare yourself.

965
01:01:58,429 --> 01:02:00,264
How dare you?

966
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:04,700
Your husband works all day until his knees are worn,

967
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:07,334
his body is crushed, and his back is humped,

968
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:10,334
and you won't cook for him? After all he does?

969
01:02:44,179 --> 01:02:45,274
Dad.

970
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:50,215
Eun Byeol.

971
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:53,184
It's been a long time.

972
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:55,314
Are you okay?

973
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,415
Are you doing well at university?

974
01:02:58,219 --> 01:03:00,225
You have that many questions...

975
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:01,855
and never visited?

976
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:03,795
Didn't you miss me?

977
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:05,155
I'm sorry, Eun Byeol.

978
01:03:05,929 --> 01:03:08,169
There was something I had to do.

979
01:03:08,169 --> 01:03:09,200
What was that?

980
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,735
Did it have something to do with Ro Na?

981
01:03:12,169 --> 01:03:13,905
Are you looking into her mom's death?

982
01:03:14,609 --> 01:03:16,405
Why should you?

983
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:18,504
Because you married her?

984
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:21,574
Does Ro Na's mom mean more to you than your own daughter?

985
01:03:24,279 --> 01:03:26,014
She's important to me.

986
01:03:26,589 --> 01:03:29,184
And you're no longer a child.

987
01:03:29,589 --> 01:03:32,014
I won't put up with your tantrums anymore.

988
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,684
Tell me why you came to see me.

989
01:03:38,859 --> 01:03:41,624
This medication. Why do you have it?

990
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,099
Did you take it?

991
01:03:44,099 --> 01:03:45,434
What's going on?

992
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:47,605
Did Ro Na call you?

993
01:03:48,039 --> 01:03:49,409
Is that why you're here?

994
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:51,374
This pill erases memories.

995
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:53,745
It's what you took after Ro Na's accident.

996
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:55,310
Who gave it to you?

997
01:03:55,310 --> 01:03:57,349
Was it Jin Bun Hong? Or your mom?

998
01:03:57,349 --> 01:04:00,184
It's just for my headaches! Don't mind it!

999
01:04:02,349 --> 01:04:05,355
Eun Byeol. When Ro Na's mom died.

1000
01:04:05,859 --> 01:04:07,184
What did you see?

1001
01:04:07,330 --> 01:04:08,760
You know something, don't you?

1002
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:11,655
You're taking the pills to hide the truth.

1003
01:04:13,570 --> 01:04:15,465
Did Ro Na ask you to find out?

1004
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,640
I don't know. I don't remember anything!

1005
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,605
You must remember!

1006
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:23,479
You can't ignore anything anymore.

1007
01:04:23,479 --> 01:04:24,805
You and I both...

1008
01:04:25,679 --> 01:04:27,704
shouldn't do that to Ro Na anymore.

1009
01:04:28,049 --> 01:04:30,144
How much more damage do you want to do?

1010
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:33,715
What if something...

1011
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:36,555
really did happen that day?

1012
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,684
What if what I remember...

1013
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,355
has something to do with Mom?

1014
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,355
Then what?

1015
01:04:44,729 --> 01:04:46,324
You still need to remember.

1016
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:48,394
Whatever the truth is.

1017
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:52,735
I'll never abandon you.

1018
01:04:53,109 --> 01:04:54,905
So trust me.

1019
01:04:55,070 --> 01:04:58,134
And tell me everything that happened that day. Okay?

1020
01:04:58,580 --> 01:05:00,045
You're a good girl.

1021
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:07,314
I see you want to crack my head open for Bae Ro Na.

1022
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:09,415
Forget it.

1023
01:05:10,859 --> 01:05:13,884
I don't know anything.

1024
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:18,754
Eun Byeol.

1025
01:05:24,270 --> 01:05:25,565
Cheon Seo Jin.

1026
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:29,534
I'll take off that mask you're wearing with my own hands.

1027
01:05:32,809 --> 01:05:34,404
I finally found him.

1028
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:35,904
Logan is alive.

1029
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:41,485
Was Joo Dan Tae behind it?

1030
01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:43,220
And the guy beside him?

1031
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:45,254
Joo Dan Tae's doctor friend.

1032
01:05:45,819 --> 01:05:48,884
It seems he was used to prolonging Logan's life.

1033
01:05:51,130 --> 01:05:54,024
I told you. Joo Dan Tae is evil.

1034
01:05:54,829 --> 01:05:56,640
He set up the bomb himself...

1035
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,569
and has been torturing Logan...

1036
01:05:58,569 --> 01:06:00,309
without actually killing him.

1037
01:06:00,309 --> 01:06:02,679
That crazy psychopath!

1038
01:06:02,679 --> 01:06:03,935
Please kill Joo Dan Tae...

1039
01:06:04,409 --> 01:06:06,205
with your own hands.

1040
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,384
Where's Logan?

1041
01:06:16,819 --> 01:06:19,924
I really don't know!

1042
01:06:22,059 --> 01:06:25,524
Baek Jun Ki already told us.

1043
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:27,725
About your psycho deeds.

1044
01:06:28,199 --> 01:06:30,394
Where's Logan?

1045
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:33,309
Get a grip.

1046
01:06:33,309 --> 01:06:36,874
Baek Jun Ki is playing all of you.

1047
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:39,404
Don't even try.

1048
01:06:39,409 --> 01:06:41,350
Tell us where Logan is...

1049
01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:43,215
before we blow your head off.

1050
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:45,449
Kill me if you want.

1051
01:06:45,449 --> 01:06:46,685
But...

1052
01:06:46,689 --> 01:06:49,855
Someone else was behind all this.

1053
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:52,020
If you really want to save Logan,

1054
01:06:52,020 --> 01:06:53,860
you have to listen to me.

1055
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:57,095
What a silly tongue.

1056
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:00,394
Let me look at the picture.

1057
01:07:01,699 --> 01:07:05,134
What does it say on that trash can next to Logan?

1058
01:07:11,409 --> 01:07:12,705
Penthouse?

1059
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:14,445
Penthouse?

1060
01:07:15,409 --> 01:07:17,745
I knew it was familiar.

1061
01:07:18,419 --> 01:07:21,590
Logan's at the penthouse.

1062
01:07:21,590 --> 01:07:23,620
The one taking care of Logan right now...

1063
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:25,585
is Shim Su Ryeon.

1064
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:28,585
Shim Su Ryeon?

1065
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:31,260
Shim Su Ryeon is the one who...

1066
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:34,725
She tried to blame it all on me.

1067
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,534
The person who brought in Baek Jun Ki,

1068
01:07:37,699 --> 01:07:40,965
and the person who told him to set up the bomb...

1069
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:43,105
was Shim Su Ryeon!

This is your fault for wanting something you shouldn't have.

This position means nothing to you.

1074

But for me,

1075

Ma'am, you need to come over.

1078
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:08,384
There's a weird smell coming from behind the hall.

1079
01:09:08,860 --> 01:09:10,054
There is?

1080
01:09:25,909 --> 01:09:27,845
What kind of space is this?

1081
01:09:27,949 --> 01:09:29,549
I've never seen it before.

1082
01:09:29,549 --> 01:09:31,475

1084

by doing this to our Logan?

1086

Logan?

Logan? What are you talking about?

and keeping him locked up like this.

1091
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,524
That's quite vicious.

1092
01:10:19,669 --> 01:10:22,470
This is your revenge for Min Seol A?

1093
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:24,134
You did this, didn't you?

1094
01:10:24,199 --> 01:10:25,939
What did you do to Logan?

1095
01:10:25,939 --> 01:10:28,304
This tactic won't work anymore.

1096

We all know the truth now.

1097

You're really something, Cheon Seo Jin.

1115
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:45,874
You really tricked James.

Is it now time to celebrate?

1117

No wonder...

1118
01:11:52,929 --> 01:11:54,685
we make such great partners.

1119
01:12:00,429 --> 01:12:02,825
There's one thing I want to know.

1120
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:05,695
Why do you want to get at Shim Su Ryeon so badly?

1121

The almighty Cheon Seo Jin.

1122

- It's been a while. - It has been.

How's everyone been?

1128
01:12:24,459 --> 01:12:26,315
Right, I got this.

1129
01:12:26,730 --> 01:12:29,725
I didn't want to come empty-handed. It's a pecan pie.

1130

Let's all share it later.

1131
01:12:31,799 --> 01:12:33,624
Look at Ms. Cheon.

1132
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:36,595
She also prepared a pecan pie.

1133
01:12:37,370 --> 01:12:40,304
That's amazing. Can I try it now?

1134
01:12:40,539 --> 01:12:41,705
Well...

1135
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:44,105
Me too. I want a slice too.

1136
01:12:44,510 --> 01:12:46,034
This looks great.

1137
01:12:46,809 --> 01:12:49,010
You're so talented.

1138
01:12:49,010 --> 01:12:52,150
The taste is incomparable to store-bought ones.

1139

This is great.

1140
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,485
What goes well with dessert?

1141
01:12:56,419 --> 01:12:57,554
Honey.

1142
01:12:59,189 --> 01:13:01,329
Go bring a Bordeaux wine.

1143
01:13:01,329 --> 01:13:03,024
It's always nice to share a good wine.

1144
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:06,225
Quickly.

1145
01:13:10,539 --> 01:13:13,470
Is it fun mocking your wife in front of everyone else?

1146
01:13:13,470 --> 01:13:14,539
You like that?

1147
01:13:14,539 --> 01:13:16,380
I told you to stop trying so hard.

1148
01:13:16,380 --> 01:13:18,380
Pretending to have everything and know everything.

1149
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:19,439
Aren't you sick of it?

1150
01:13:19,439 --> 01:13:22,544
Do you want your wife to be low-class?

1151
01:13:22,909 --> 01:13:25,575
I'm doing it to save your face.

1152
01:13:25,819 --> 01:13:27,390
Be more honest.

1153
01:13:27,390 --> 01:13:30,355
Shim Su Ryeon is the real deal when it comes to being a wife.

1154
01:13:30,559 --> 01:13:32,685
Look at how Chairman Joo's business is booming.

1155
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:39,400
What are you doing?

1156
01:13:39,400 --> 01:13:42,065
You think you can just compliment someone else's wife like that?

1157
01:13:42,069 --> 01:13:43,164
You...

1158
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:47,664
I was looking for the bathroom.

1159
01:13:54,050 --> 01:13:57,875
Right then, I wanted to steal everything you had.

1160
01:13:58,179 --> 01:14:00,814
The penthouse. Your husband.

1161
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:03,759
The relaxed elegance. All of it.

1162
01:14:03,759 --> 01:14:05,584
All men are like that.

1163
01:14:05,989 --> 01:14:08,584
She annoyed me like crazy.

1164
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:12,395
The woman I had never beaten in my life.

1165
01:14:12,499 --> 01:14:13,665
Shim Su Ryeon.

1166
01:14:14,229 --> 01:14:16,225
Oh Yoon Hee and Logan...

1167
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:18,195
died because of you.

1168
01:14:19,499 --> 01:14:23,405
I had to eliminate those around you to beat you.

1169
01:14:24,610 --> 01:14:28,375
Will there ever be a day better than this?

1170
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:32,314
I got rid of everyone who has been bothering me.

1171
01:14:33,249 --> 01:14:36,614
I shall drink until I get wasted.

1172
01:14:53,669 --> 01:14:54,764
Let go.

1173
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:56,875
You're being fooled.

1174
01:14:57,239 --> 01:14:59,004
Please take me to Logan.

1175
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:00,810
I need to see...

1176
01:15:00,810 --> 01:15:03,274
how he's doing with my own eyes. I beg you.

1177
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:08,584
I didn't kill Logan.

1178
01:15:08,590 --> 01:15:10,284
I didn't do it.

1179
01:15:25,169 --> 01:15:26,534
I was in love...

1180
01:15:29,209 --> 01:15:31,074
with Logan.

1181
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:54,165
Logan.

1182
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:56,895
Su Ryeon.

1183
01:16:35,009 --> 01:16:36,405
I missed you.

(The Penthouse 3)

1186
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:29,560
Are you really Logan?

1187
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:30,800
I'm sorry it took me so long.

1188
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,499
I want Yoon Hee's revenge too.

1189
01:17:32,499 --> 01:17:34,130
Did Ro Na's mom die because of me?

1190
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:35,530
Ma Ri, what do you want me to do first?

1191
01:17:35,530 --> 01:17:36,530
I'll do as you say.

1192
01:17:36,530 --> 01:17:38,439
If something happens to me, please look after Ro Na.

1193
01:17:38,439 --> 01:17:41,209
The tallest building in the world. Imagine that.

1194
01:17:41,209 --> 01:17:42,810
It's your turn now, Joo Dan Tae.

1195
01:17:42,810 --> 01:17:45,340
I'm giving you one last chance.

1196
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:47,675
What happened that day? Tell me!
