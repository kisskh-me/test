<i>I feel like as far as I remember</i>

00:57:14.514 --> 00:57:17.851 line:95%,end
<i>ever since I was a kid,
I’ve always been the shy kid.</i>

00:57:19.227 --> 00:57:23.189 line:95%,end
<i>I didn’t really like
talking in front of a lot of people.</i>

00:57:24.816 --> 00:57:28.486 line:95%,end
<i>I have a strive
on searching for something new inside</i>

00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:32.240 line:95%,end
<i>where I want to develop that
into something of my own,</i>

00:57:33.366 --> 00:57:36.995 line:95%,end
<i>and create something
that hasn’t been out to the world.</i>

00:57:39.414 --> 00:57:43.668 line:95%,end
<i>But when it comes to performing on stage,</i>

00:57:44.461 --> 00:57:49.340 line:95%,end
<i>I think I put on this entire new self,</i>

00:57:49.424 --> 00:57:51.509 line:95%,end
<i>where I’m not afraid.</i>

00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:00.185 line:95%,end
<i>When I’m performing,</i>
<i>I forget about everything.</i>

00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:02.520 line:95%,end
<i>It’s just all about me,</i>

00:58:03.104 --> 00:58:06.274 line:95%,end
<i>expressing myself, expressing our music.</i>

00:58:06.983 --> 00:58:10.612 line:95%,end
<i>I guess I do have a switch inside
somewhere where I turn it on and off,</i>

00:58:11.196 --> 00:58:12.989 line:95%,end
<i>but it’s not something
that I do purposely.</i>

00:58:13.656 --> 00:58:15.450 line:95%,end
<i>I think it reacts with music.</i>

00:58:16.034 --> 00:58:21.873 line:95%,end
<i>And the very first energy that I meet
whenever I first jump up on the stage.</i>

00:58:43.603 --> 00:58:46.564 line:95%,end
<i>I wanna say it’s just something
that I was born with,</i>

00:58:46.648 --> 00:58:49.400 line:95%,end
<i>because I’m proud of it,
and I'm happy doing it.</i>

00:58:50.527 --> 00:58:51.486 line:95%,end
<i>So yeah.</i>

01:01:48.413 --> 01:01:52.250 line:95%,end
<i>I think our identity is rather fixed.</i>

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:54.627 line:95%,end
<i>I like to think that</i>

01:01:54.711 --> 01:01:58.297 line:95%,end
<i>we have a lot of pride
in having both colors, black and pink.</i>

01:01:58.381 --> 01:01:59.841 line:95%,end
But because of that,

01:01:59.924 --> 01:02:03.970 line:95%,end
we’re still in the process
of continuously experimenting.
