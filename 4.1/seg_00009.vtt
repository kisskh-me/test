01:02:04.053 --> 01:02:07.724 line:95%,end
<i>And fortunately, rather than
not being able to predict it,</i>

01:02:07.807 --> 01:02:11.978 line:95%,end
<i>we continue to go forward
in the direction that we want.</i>

01:02:12.061 --> 01:02:15.398 line:95%,end
I just enjoy the whole process.

01:02:15.481 --> 01:02:17.066 line:95%,end
<i>We all grew up in different cultures.</i>

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:19.569 line:95%,end
<i>These various cultures overlapped
and a group was born.</i>

01:02:20.611 --> 01:02:22.613 line:95%,end
But instead of forcing them into one

01:02:22.697 --> 01:02:26.367 line:95%,end
we worked as a group

01:02:26.451 --> 01:02:28.828 line:95%,end
without losing each of our individuality.

01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:33.583 line:95%,end
I think that rather emerged
as the color of the group BLACKPINK.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:38.838 line:95%,end
I think we shine the brightest

01:02:38.921 --> 01:02:41.132 line:95%,end
when we do what we love to do.

01:02:41.215 --> 01:02:43.676 line:95%,end
Now that’d be music, right?

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:48.639 line:95%,end
When we are fully expressing
what we want to express,

01:02:49.265 --> 01:02:52.435 line:95%,end
that’s when we shine the brightest.

01:02:52.518 --> 01:02:55.897 line:95%,end
<i>So I think it’d be great for us to show</i>

01:02:55.980 --> 01:03:00.359 line:95%,end
a lot of things
that we enjoy doing in the future.

01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:03.529 line:95%,end
<i>As we do this,
we’ve always done everything thinking,</i>

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:08.242 line:95%,end
<i>"We could show something like this.
This time, we can show this."</i>

01:03:08.868 --> 01:03:12.872 line:95%,end
<i>I think we can
continue to show different sides of us.</i>

01:03:13.748 --> 01:03:18.878 line:95%,end
We plan on continuing to do
what we want and show it.

01:03:23.257 --> 01:03:27.887 line:95%,end
Five years is not too short
and not too long of a time, right?

01:03:28.513 --> 01:03:32.350 line:95%,end
<i>But a lot of different things happened.</i>

01:03:32.934 --> 01:03:35.937 line:95%,end
<i>There were happy times, and sad times.</i>

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:43.736 line:95%,end
<i>I think those were
the happiest times of my 20s.</i>

01:03:46.781 --> 01:03:50.034 line:95%,end
<i>When we were on the tour,</i>

01:03:50.117 --> 01:03:54.121 line:95%,end
<i>I’d always feel hectic thinking about</i>

01:03:54.205 --> 01:03:57.500 line:95%,end
<i>which city we have to go next and such.</i>

01:03:58.084 --> 01:04:02.338 line:95%,end
But after seeing this video,
I could see that we laughed a lot

01:04:02.421 --> 01:04:07.426 line:95%,end
<i>and really enjoyed our time together.</i>

01:04:09.136 --> 01:04:13.850 line:95%,end
When we first debuted,
we faced all kinds of experiences.

01:04:14.433 --> 01:04:17.895 line:95%,end
<i>Back, then, there was a fear
about whether or not we were doing well,</i>

01:04:17.979 --> 01:04:21.440 line:95%,end
<i>feeling uncertain about some things.</i>

01:04:22.066 --> 01:04:24.193 line:95%,end
<i>When we had our first concert,</i>

01:04:24.944 --> 01:04:30.950 line:95%,end
what we say on stage is
also a very important part of our concert.

01:04:31.033 --> 01:04:35.955 line:95%,end
I was really nervous, like,
"Let’s not make any mistake."

01:04:36.163 --> 01:04:40.835 line:95%,end
It’s already been a little over two years
since we debuted.

01:04:40.918 --> 01:04:44.881 line:95%,end
And to be able to have a concert

01:04:44.964 --> 01:04:49.677 line:95%,end
at such a big venue in Korea
in Seoul like this…

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:54.015 line:95%,end
Even as I’m saying it,
I feel like we’ve improved very much.

01:04:54.098 --> 01:04:57.435 line:95%,end
And it was all possible thanks to BLINKs.
Right, everyone?

01:04:57.518 --> 01:05:00.771 line:95%,end
We’ve been together since day one.

01:05:00.855 --> 01:05:05.651 line:95%,end
I like to think we’ve grown a little bit
seeing how we’ve become more comfortable

01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:09.113 line:95%,end
with making a speech
and looking after one another

01:05:09.196 --> 01:05:10.489 line:95%,end
<i>when we're on stage.</i>

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:13.784 line:95%,end
<i>I like to believe that</i>

01:05:13.868 --> 01:05:16.621 line:95%,end
we still have that energy
from when we were trainees.

01:05:18.539 --> 01:05:22.001 line:95%,end
I’m so moved,
thank you all so much for coming.

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:26.464 line:95%,end
<i>Since the four of us are in this together,
we decided to have a talk</i>

01:05:26.547 --> 01:05:31.427 line:95%,end
<i>on trusting each other more
and trying to enjoy everything.</i>

01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:35.514 line:95%,end
Since then, it became more enjoyable
to take on new challenges,

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:39.101 line:95%,end
we became more excited,
and began to look forward to things.

01:05:39.185 --> 01:05:41.395 line:95%,end
I think we grew up a little.

01:05:41.479 --> 01:05:47.735 line:95%,end
We are always here for you, BLINKs,
so please stay with us too. Thank you!

01:05:48.653 --> 01:05:50.237 line:95%,end
When the four of us are together,

01:05:50.321 --> 01:05:55.076 line:95%,end
we always laugh and talk
just like we did when we were trainees.

01:05:55.159 --> 01:05:57.912 line:95%,end
It’s just so fun to work together too.

01:05:57.995 --> 01:06:00.164 line:95%,end
-I think we’re the same.
-We are the same.

01:06:01.248 --> 01:06:03.542 line:95%,end
Now we don’t even have to say a word.

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:06.629 line:95%,end
We just look
at each other’s eyes and know.

01:06:07.296 --> 01:06:08.547 line:95%,end
We just know.

01:06:08.631 --> 01:06:10.132 line:95%,end
Tell us, Lisa.

01:06:10.216 --> 01:06:14.428 line:95%,end
Yes. Thanks to all of your support

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:19.100 line:95%,end
and love, I will strive to work harder

01:06:19.183 --> 01:06:21.602 line:95%,end
as Lisa of BLACKPINK, everyone.

01:06:21.686 --> 01:06:22.979 line:95%,end
I love you, BLINKs.
