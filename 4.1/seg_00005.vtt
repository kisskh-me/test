<i>I guess I thought that
I am a lot stronger than I believed.</i>

00:37:06.307 --> 00:37:09.852 line:95%,end
<i>There are times when I feel hurt</i>

00:37:10.311 --> 00:37:13.606 line:95%,end
<i>or when I go through hardships,</i>

00:37:13.689 --> 00:37:16.442 line:95%,end
<i>but my way of overcoming those times is</i>

00:37:16.525 --> 00:37:19.445 line:95%,end
<i>preparing more for what's to come</i>

00:37:19.528 --> 00:37:21.948 line:95%,end

<i>That’s a hard one.</i>

00:37:59.235 --> 00:38:00.778 line:95%,end
<i>Well…</i>

00:38:02.738 --> 00:38:06.033 line:95%,end
<i>I think I just live my life
enjoying every moment.</i>

00:38:36.939 --> 00:38:39.025 line:95%,end
<i>What I felt throughout the process is</i>

00:38:39.108 --> 00:38:42.570 line:95%,end
<i>that if I think too far ahead</i>

00:38:43.154 --> 00:38:45.156 line:95%,end
<i>about the things that hasn't happened yet.</i>

00:38:45.239 --> 00:38:46.907 line:95%,end
<i>I could also get anxious
and worry about it,</i>

00:38:46.991 --> 00:38:48.951 line:95%,end
<i>then end up missing many things.</i>

00:38:49.035 --> 00:38:51.787 line:95%,end
<i>So I try to live in the moment</i>

00:38:51.871 --> 00:38:56.000 line:95%,end
<i>and try to have fun, I think.</i>

Oh yes!

00:39:10.556 --> 00:39:13.642 line:95%,end
<i>It's almost time to meet all the BLINKs</i>

00:39:13.726 --> 00:39:16.771 line:95%,end
<i>from all over the world</i>
<i>who have waited so long.</i>

00:39:16.854 --> 00:39:18.314 line:95%,end
<i>I am very nervous,</i>

00:39:18.397 --> 00:39:21.650 line:95%,end

BANGKOK

00:39:36.791 --> 00:39:40.378 line:95%,end
Thailand is also Lisa's hometown,

00:39:40.461 --> 00:39:46.300 line:95%,end
so I think it's more meaningful to start
our world tour in Lisa's hometown.

00:39:46.384 --> 00:39:51.555 line:95%,end
Starting from Thailand,
we're going to North America

00:39:51.639 --> 00:39:55.559 line:95%,end
and Europe
to meet BLINKs around the world.

00:39:55.643 --> 00:39:58.437 line:95%,end
I'm so honored and looking forward to it.

00:40:05.903 --> 00:40:11.200 line:95%,end
<i>The phrase "BLACKPINK's world tour"
still feels very foreign to me.</i>

00:40:11.283 --> 00:40:14.245 line:95%,end
I still can't believe it.

00:40:18.624 --> 00:40:22.628 line:95%,end
I prepared lots of fun stuff
for our concert

00:40:23.129 --> 00:40:26.590 line:95%,end
and want to do more exciting things
in different countries.

00:40:26.674 --> 00:40:28.968 line:95%,end
That's how I feel.

00:40:29.051 --> 00:40:34.140 line:95%,end
I hope many BLINKs around the world come.
It's gonna be fun.

What’s up, Bangkok!

00:41:24.982 --> 00:41:26.984 line:95%,end
It was very touching.

00:41:27.067 --> 00:41:31.280 line:95%,end
I think I'm very lucky to see them,
I could really tell how hard they tried,

00:41:31.363 --> 00:41:36.827 line:95%,end
<i>from the beginning to the end.
I hope they take care of themselves.</i>

00:41:36.911 --> 00:41:40.748 line:95%,end
I hope everyone stays healthy

00:41:40.831 --> 00:41:44.960 line:95%,end
<i>because they have to go perform
all around the world.</i>
