<i>I think those were really hectic moments.
Because it was our first time.</i>

00:06:50.868 --> 00:06:53.663 line:95%,end
I'm facing the stage right now

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:57.417 line:95%,end
<i>and those were the seats for BLINKS.</i>

00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:03.840 line:95%,end
There was a stage
that stretched out to the front

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:06.801 line:95%,end
<i>and we ran underneath the stage.</i>

00:07:07.718 --> 00:07:11.889 line:95%,end
<i>I think the most nervous moment is
when we walk toward the backstage</i>

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:14.225 line:95%,end
<i>with the anticipation of meeting our fans</i>

00:07:14.308 --> 00:07:18.354 line:95%,end
<i>and performing for them.
I think that’s the most nervous moment.</i>

00:09:46.043 --> 00:09:50.214 line:95%,end
<i>You know, we haven't been able</i>
<i>to perform live for a while now.</i>

00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:52.967 line:95%,end
<i>And now that I think back at it</i>

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:59.682 line:95%,end
performing on stage is
one of the best parts.

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:03.978 line:95%,end
<i>I feel alive when I see our fans</i>

00:10:04.061 --> 00:10:08.691 line:95%,end
<i>singing along to my song and enjoying it.</i>

00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:12.653 line:95%,end
<i>That feeling of success like,</i>
<i>"Wow I did it."</i>

00:10:12.737 --> 00:10:16.032 line:95%,end
<i>"They’re dancing together like I am!"</i>

00:10:16.115 --> 00:10:19.327 line:95%,end
<i>When I feel that,
I think that’s when I feel most alive.</i>

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:24.081 line:95%,end
<i>It’s upsetting that we can’t</i>
<i>have the fans watch the performance.</i>

00:10:25.249 --> 00:10:28.044 line:95%,end
<i>But I think it just makes us more, like,</i>

00:10:28.919 --> 00:10:32.173 line:95%,end
you know, gives us more space
to look forward to that day,

00:10:32.256 --> 00:10:35.968 line:95%,end
and when that day comes for us,
we'll actually be in one room together.

00:10:37.011 --> 00:10:39.347 line:95%,end
That would be a very very special moment.

00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:43.309 line:95%,end
Wouldn’t there be much to talk about
when we meet? From now on?

00:10:43.392 --> 00:10:45.645 line:95%,end
So I'm looking forward to it.

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:48.314 line:95%,end

during the concert is

-definitely really great.
-What's next?

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:41.659 line:95%,end
The energy is actually unreal.

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:48.124 line:95%,end
All the instruments in the back,
singing live.
