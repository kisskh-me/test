01:16:42.264 --> 01:16:43.932 line:95%,end
BLINKs.

01:16:44.641 --> 01:16:50.063 line:95%,end
We just finished the last US show. Yay!

01:16:50.564 --> 01:16:52.649 line:95%,end
Wow, I still can’t hear anything.

01:16:53.984 --> 01:16:55.235 line:95%,end
Is my voice coming out alright?

01:16:55.319 --> 01:16:58.447 line:95%,end
I’m so sad it’s already over.

01:16:58.530 --> 01:17:04.786 line:95%,end
I'm sad to see it come to an end.
It feels bittersweet.

01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:08.248 line:95%,end
Over the past month and a half

01:17:09.041 --> 01:17:13.670 line:95%,end
there were
many new and exciting experiences.

01:17:13.754 --> 01:17:18.925 line:95%,end
Still, I had a lot of time
to relax in different cities.

01:17:21.011 --> 01:17:22.304 line:95%,end
It was great.

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:27.976 line:95%,end
<i>We performed a lot,
and it was a meaningful time.</i>

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:32.773 line:95%,end
<i>I think I enjoyed every moment
more than I thought I would.</i>

01:17:32.856 --> 01:17:36.026 line:95%,end
<i>It was a meaningful tour,
like a surprise gift.</i>

01:17:36.943 --> 01:17:39.863 line:95%,end
<i>What I felt the most during the tour was…</i>

01:17:42.407 --> 01:17:45.619 line:95%,end
<i>It really was a time for me</i>

01:17:45.702 --> 01:17:49.247 line:95%,end
<i>to rethink of myself
as a member of BLACKPINK.</i>

01:17:57.631 --> 01:18:02.886 line:95%,end
I honestly don’t think we’ve changed much
just because it’s been five years.

01:18:02.969 --> 01:18:05.472 line:95%,end
<i>We haven’t changed much,</i>

01:18:05.555 --> 01:18:08.642 line:95%,end
<i>but what's more reassuring is
having fans by our side,</i>

01:18:08.725 --> 01:18:12.270 line:95%,end
<i>who have always supported us
for the last five years.</i>

01:18:12.354 --> 01:18:15.315 line:95%,end
There will be the sixth
and the seventh anniversary in the future,

01:18:15.399 --> 01:18:21.029 line:95%,end
and it feels like
we’re getting stronger over the years.

01:18:21.113 --> 01:18:25.826 line:95%,end
I really like the feeling of us and BLINKs

01:18:25.909 --> 01:18:27.953 line:95%,end
becoming a lot closer.

01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:31.164 line:95%,end
I can’t believe
it's already been five years.

01:18:33.542 --> 01:18:39.214 line:95%,end
I wish this movie gets
a little bit of our BLINKs'

01:18:40.424 --> 01:18:43.176 line:95%,end
frustration out, and

01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:47.597 line:95%,end
it’s a good memory
that we are also gonna have.

01:18:47.681 --> 01:18:50.976 line:95%,end
And we can look back at it next year
and talk about it, maybe?

01:18:51.768 --> 01:18:54.771 line:95%,end
It’s a new step for us,
I’m really glad that

01:18:55.731 --> 01:18:57.774 line:95%,end
we got this opportunity.

01:18:59.526 --> 01:19:01.194 line:95%,end
And I miss you guys.

01:19:27.596 --> 01:19:32.476 line:95%,end
<i>I feel like I cried a lot
over the five years.</i>

01:19:32.559 --> 01:19:37.314 line:95%,end
<i>When I watch the videos
from my fans, I tear up.</i>

01:19:37.397 --> 01:19:41.318 line:95%,end
I was so touched
when I just saw that video.

01:19:41.401 --> 01:19:45.030 line:95%,end
Even now as I’m talking,
I feel like I’m going to cry.

01:19:45.113 --> 01:19:49.910 line:95%,end
Because those were such happy times.

01:20:02.422 --> 01:20:06.301 line:95%,end
<i>Five years ago,
we were five years younger,</i>

01:20:06.384 --> 01:20:09.179 line:95%,end
and it was probably the same
with our BLINKs.

01:20:09.262 --> 01:20:11.264 line:95%,end
As we continued to grow,

01:20:11.348 --> 01:20:15.393 line:95%,end
I was very happy
to be able to share that time with BLINKs.

01:20:15.477 --> 01:20:19.773 line:95%,end
<i>I miss them so much
since we haven’t been able to meet lately.</i>

01:20:19.856 --> 01:20:23.735 line:95%,end
<i>But because we missed each other so much,
when we meet again,</i>

01:20:23.819 --> 01:20:26.029 line:95%,end
<i>I’m so excited at the thought</i>

01:20:26.112 --> 01:20:30.075 line:95%,end
<i>that we’ll be able to greet them
with the biggest joy.</i>

01:20:30.158 --> 01:20:32.160 line:95%,end
Thank you so much
for always worrying about us,

01:20:32.244 --> 01:20:36.039 line:95%,end
and above all, thank you that
you always show us love and support.

01:20:36.122 --> 01:20:38.166 line:95%,end
We miss you so much.

01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:42.295 line:95%,end
<i>BLINKs have always been there by our side</i>

01:20:42.379 --> 01:20:44.673 line:95%,end
no matter which year of our career it is,

01:20:44.756 --> 01:20:48.635 line:95%,end
showing us so much unchanging love.

01:20:49.094 --> 01:20:53.431 line:95%,end
That's what makes us
want to move forward further.

01:20:53.515 --> 01:20:58.311 line:95%,end
I hope you stay with BLACKPINK
all the way,

01:20:58.395 --> 01:21:02.065 line:95%,end
as if we are lifelong companions.

01:21:02.148 --> 01:21:05.110 line:95%,end
Thank you, and love you always.

01:21:07.404 --> 01:21:13.493 line:95%,end
Whenever we talk about how we feel inside,

01:21:13.577 --> 01:21:15.161 line:95%,end
I always have nothing to say.

01:21:15.245 --> 01:21:17.372 line:95%,end
I feel very shy about it, but…

01:21:29.551 --> 01:21:30.760 line:95%,end
What should I say?

01:21:35.974 --> 01:21:40.312 line:95%,end
There are so many things
that I wanted to say, but…

01:21:41.563 --> 01:21:44.274 line:95%,end
To keep it short…
