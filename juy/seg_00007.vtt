00:47:11.912 --> 00:47:13.539 line:95%,end

00:47:13.622 --> 00:47:17.668 line:95%,end

as a 16-year-old,</i>

00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:20.546 line:95%,end

00:47:21.672 --> 00:47:24.132 line:95%,end

00:47:47.447 --> 00:47:52.536 line:95%,end
<i>I always have to think back on
how passionate I was towards music</i>

00:47:54.538 --> 00:47:56.832 line:95%,end

00:47:56.915 --> 00:48:00.502 line:95%,end
<i>And it turned out to become my life now</i>

00:48:00.586 --> 00:48:02.671 line:95%,end
<i>to the current day too, so…</i>

00:48:02.754 --> 00:48:04.506 line:95%,end

00:48:26.945 --> 00:48:30.908 line:95%,end

my solo project</i>

00:48:30.991 --> 00:48:35.913 line:95%,end
<i>I had just finished
the last shoot for "Gone,"</i>

00:48:35.996 --> 00:48:38.749 line:95%,end
<i>so that was the second music video</i>
<i>I did back-to-back.</i>

00:48:39.333 --> 00:48:42.628 line:95%,end

I'm actually saying this out loud</i>

00:48:57.809 --> 00:48:59.227 line:95%,end
<i>I think I tried my best.</i>

00:48:59.686 --> 00:49:01.688 line:95%,end
<i>I don’t think I would go back</i>
<i>and change anything,</i>

00:49:01.772 --> 00:49:05.150 line:95%,end
<i>because I really did try</i>
<i>to pour my heart and soul into it.</i>
