00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,000

Take a seat, please.

10
00:03:16,119 --> 00:03:17,679
Why isn't Young Master Zhang here yet?

11
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,600
Young Master Zhang's wife is not feeling well.

12
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,479
Young Master Zhang stays home
to look after his wife.

13
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,160
Help yourself.

00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,160
Enjoy the music and tea.

Help yourself.

It's time for the Shadow Play.

17
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:31,320
Shadow Play is here. That's great.

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:31,839
Come on.

00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:32,960
De, take a seat here.

20
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:36,279
I gave up on wealth and name.

21
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,720
Bit goodbye to my parents
and start on the misery journey.

22
00:03:40,399 --> 00:03:43,080
There are a lot of blaming and regrets

23
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:46,960
when all I did for the love I thought
is no longer there.

24

"The 18 Years' Waiting
with Loneliness and Miserable."

26
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:53,919
That's the same old story
you have been telling.

27
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,759
This is the only song you know.

28
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,759
Keep repeating the same.

29
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,000
Treat us like a fool!

30
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,119
Such a boring story.

31
00:03:59,119 --> 00:04:00,000
Can you do another one?

32
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,039

00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,239
Who says that he doesn't have
any more story to tell?

41
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,239
He has stories.

42
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,640
My name is Sun Yu Lou.

43
00:05:46,359 --> 00:05:48,839
The incident happened when I was 18 years old.

44
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,040
That was the most happening year
of the Sun Family.

45

[Shunzhen Gate]

46
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,880
My eldest sister, Sun You Zhen

47
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,880
was appointed as Imperial Noble Consort
upon her arrival in the palace.

48
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,079
3000 beauties in the harem,

49
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,640
but she had all the love.

50
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,079
The emperor extended his love to the family.

51
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,440
My father, Sun Xun

52
00:06:43,679 --> 00:06:45,480
was appointed as Senior Grand Secretary.

53
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,200
He was highly respected.

54
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,640
My mother, from the Shen Family is a Buddhism.

55
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,399
She is a vegetarian
and practices her prayer every day.

56
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,559
She is very kind,

57
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,000
but for some reason,

58
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:07,079
my father's concubines are very afraid of her.

59
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,720
When I was 18 years old,

60
00:07:09,119 --> 00:07:10,880
a few of my father's wives passed away.

61
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,959
There was only Aunt Mei
who kept my mom company.

62
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,320
Speaking of Aunt Mei,

63
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,799
she seemed to be difficult to get along with,

64
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:19,600
but she was in awe of my mother.

65
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,160
If you don't feel like doing the prayer,

66
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,239
just head back.

67
00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:39,839
Beauty is waiting for someone
behind the bead curtain.

68
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:43,079
She points her head down and frowns.

69
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,079
Tears could be seen on her face.

70
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:50,720
Not sure who's making her upset.

71
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,119
My eldest brother,
Sun Shi Jie is very knowledgeable

72
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,160
and talented.

73
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,079
My first young madam, Wu Yue Hong

74
00:07:59,359 --> 00:08:01,160
is the only daughter of
General of Agile Cavalry, Wu Da.

75
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,600
My father and Wu Da are best friends
since they were young.

76
00:08:03,799 --> 00:08:05,359
The Sun and Wu families agreed to
their children's marriage before they were born.

77
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,399
When their children are at their age
to get married,

78
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,160
they will get married.

79
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:11,399
However, my brother

80
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,359
doesn't like his wife that much.

How do I

84
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:01,479
look today?

85
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:15,840
You...

86
00:09:17,479 --> 00:09:18,760
What are you dressed like that?

87
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,799

who could dance gracefully.

90
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,119
I could move as fast as a flying bird

91
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,679
and walk as a fairy.

92
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:44,440
Let me show you.

93
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:15,239
You are aping the beauty. That's absurd.

94
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,479
Where are you going, master?

95
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:20,719
Please don't go, Master.

96

99
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,400
is there any difference between me
and the person in the painting?

100
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,039
I got it.

101
00:11:04,359 --> 00:11:05,000
Let me tell you.

102
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:07,599
Lipstick's color of the person
in the painting is red.

103
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:09,000
Mine is Crimson.

104
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,239
Seems like the master is upset
about the lipstick color.

105
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,679
Shi Jian, bring the brush.

106
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,719
Get her color changes to Crimson.

107
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,080

is the most talented woman in the Capital.

111
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,359
Not long after she gets married
to my second brother, Sun Jun Hao,

father gave his military power

113
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,520
to my second brother.

114
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,599
My second brother is very busy in the army

115
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:45,520
and seldom come home.

116
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,559
Both of them didn't spend time together.

117
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,159
My second young madam kills her time
with playing zither every day.

118
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,919
Everyone in the Sun Residence could hear it.

119
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,679
Oh, my.

120
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,880
Whose lipstick was that?

121
00:12:16,119 --> 00:12:16,679
Lipstick?

122
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,840
Young madam got it wrong.

123
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:20,919
It's...

124
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,960
There are a lot of dishes with chilies today.

125
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,520
It must have been the chilies.

126
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,039
So, it was the chilies!

127
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,520
The chilies?

128
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:28,799
Yes.

129
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm done.

130
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,359
It's the chilies.

131
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,039
A misunderstanding.

132
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,440
Was it the chilies?

133
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,200
You don't even get this red with my slap.

134
00:13:07,239 --> 00:13:08,159
Prick up your ears.

in the Residence,

Stop pretending!

148
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,400
After you finished these chilies,

149
00:13:43,719 --> 00:13:45,320
you would be able to come clean.

162
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:25,880
terrified as a mouse confronting a cat

163
00:14:26,239 --> 00:14:27,559

164
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:29,440

00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:00,159
It made it worse.

170

She is gone and we've buried her body.

372
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:19,599
My poor apprentice.

373
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,239
What are you doing? That's hurt!

374
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:54,160
My lady,

375
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,680
that girl knocked you out yesterday

376
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:59,800
and took all your credits in Sun Reside.

377
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,000
Why didn't you mention it?

378
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,839
Who doesn't know that me, Lady Yu

379
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:08,880
is the best Pipa player in the Capital?

380
00:29:09,199 --> 00:29:11,000
She is just a fledgling player

381
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,680
who try to snatch my reputation.

382
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:14,920
Stop dreaming!

383
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,760
If she would like to address herself
as my apprentice,

384
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,439
I will let her be.

385
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,760
In the future, even if she is able
to make some small accomplishments,

386
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,640
she would still be under my name.

387
00:29:27,959 --> 00:29:28,880
Good.

388
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,760
Please have the water, senior.

389
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,239
It's your turn, Xiao Yu.

390
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:34,319
Alright.

391
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,040
Be careful.

392
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,479
It's fine.

393
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,239
Senior, your headgear.

394
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:46,439
Alright.

395
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,319
Senior, come over quickly.

396
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:48,839
What's wrong? What's wrong?

397
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:50,280
Everyone comes over quickly.

398
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:50,920
What's wrong, Shao Chun?

399
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,119
Hurry up. Hurry up.

400
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,680
We are here. What's wrong?

401
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:57,800
Shao Chun, you are so good.

402
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,199
You can make this much money
by posing as Lady Yu.

403
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:01,000
Of course.

404
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,520
In the Bai Theatrical Troupe,
Shao Chun is the most skillful.

405
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,560
That's right.

406
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,599
This is our senior. Senior is the best.

407
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,880
We must keep it from the master.

408
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:11,520
Otherwise, we would be punished.

409
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,400
Shao Chun,

410
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,040
come with me.

411
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:20,560
Yes.

412
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:31,319
Master.

413
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,359
Master?

414
00:30:36,199 --> 00:30:38,520
Do you still see me as your master?

415
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,160
You acted as bold as brass
with such little skill.

416
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,400
Do you have any idea

417
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,119
what kind of disaster
you could have made yesterday?

418
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,839
I just wanted to give it a try

419
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,520
to see if the skills I have learned
from you are useful.

420
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,680
The skills I teach you
are for you to perform on the stage.

421
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:52,680
I didn't ask to use them off stage.

422
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:53,959
But you would have known

423
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,000
that I will use them off stage eventually.

424
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
It's not the time yet.

425
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,319
So, when would it be?

426
00:30:59,479 --> 00:31:01,319
When you can put up a nice play.

427
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,119
I earned my reward and a round of applause.

428
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:04,199
Aren't those good enough?

429
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:06,979
[Animitta]

430
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:09,280
If you think this little money you made

431
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,319
and a few people clapped for you
are considered as well done,

432
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,119
that wouldn't be anything more
I could teach you.

433
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,680
Go.

434
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:20,800
Master, this is not fair.

435
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,920
You would be lost

436
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,400
with being impatient

437
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:26,400
and rush for quick results.

438
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,239
Master.

439
00:31:52,667 --> 00:31:55,368
[Animitta]

440
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,880
(You would be lost)

441
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:10,040
(with being impatient)

442
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,479
(and rush for quick results.)

443
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:35,160
(She caught a cold last night
when she was home.)

444
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,719
(She is gone and we've buried her body.)

445
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,880
(Ghost.)

446
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,880
(I love her)

447
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:55,839
(and it doesn't matter
if she is a human or ghost.)

448
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,079
Miss...

449
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,439
Are you the spirit of her, miss?

450
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:47,040
Who are you?

451
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,640
I saw your Pipa performance before

452
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,599
and I am impressed with your skills.

453
00:33:53,439 --> 00:33:54,719
I was hoping to make acquaintance with you.

454
00:33:55,479 --> 00:33:56,880
However, when I approached today,

455
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:01,199
I was told that you have passed away.

456
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:04,119
Passed away?

457
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,400
Miss,

458
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:09,840
are you alive or you are the ghost?

459
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,679
(Is he a fool?)

460
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,080
I'm a ghost.

461
00:34:35,438 --> 00:34:37,678
Aren't you afraid of me?

462
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,080
I'm not afraid.

463
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,320
I'm not afraid.

464
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,959
Do I have the pleasure

465
00:34:58,479 --> 00:34:59,800
to have a drink with you?

466
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:04,360
That's good.

467
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,199
Please come with me to the Jaws of Death.

468
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,520
Miss.

469
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,280
Miss.

470
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,479
Wait for me.

471
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,479
Miss.

472
00:35:41,399 --> 00:35:42,080
Miss.

473
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,560
Miss.

474
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:46,879
Miss.

475
00:35:47,919 --> 00:35:48,800
Where are you, miss?

476
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,479
Miss.

477
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:54,120
Miss. Miss.

478
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,120
Where are you, miss?

479
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:56,800
Miss.

480
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:58,679
Where are you, miss?

481
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:01,479
Miss.

482
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:03,159
Miss.

483
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:03,919
Idiot.

484
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:23,439
I am home, granny.

485
00:36:23,959 --> 00:36:24,959
You're home, Ms. Lin.

486
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,040
Lit the incense.

487
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:44,159
Why are you wet, Ms. Lin?

488
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:47,360
Nothing. I fell into the pond.

489
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,840
I couldn't be with you all the time

490
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,239
which you would have to
take good care of yourself, Ms. Lin.

491
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,479
How was your school today?

492
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,399
Imperial examination is right at the corner.

493
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,800
You're joining the troupe at day time
and studying at night.

494
00:36:59,919 --> 00:37:00,800
You can't fall sick.

495
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:03,239
Let me get you some ginger soup
to keep you warm.

496
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:04,239
Granny,

497
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,879
I am not going
to the Bai Theatrical Troupe anymore.

498
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:09,040
Why?

499
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,800
I was kicked out by the master.

500
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,639
What should we do then?

501
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,879
What mistake that you have made?

502
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,800
Why you are being kicked out?

503
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,159
Let's beg Master Liu.

504
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,719
Ask for her forgiveness.

505
00:37:22,919 --> 00:37:23,679
That's not needed,

506
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,919
I'm capable to succeed by myself.

507
00:37:26,399 --> 00:37:28,080
Why are you being so stubborn, Ms. Lin?

508
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,159
The entire skills of this Liu Three Arts

509
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:31,520
are compiled into these Three Arts.

510
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,399
If you didn't complete the last art,

511
00:37:33,879 --> 00:37:35,399
how would you be able to join the examination?

512
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,959
You are different from others. You are a girl.

513
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,320
If they found out,

514
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,879
it'd be a felony to get yourself killed.

515
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,639
It wouldn't happen, granny.

516
00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:44,959
I have learned for so many years.

517
00:37:44,959 --> 00:37:46,199
I would at least get some parts of it

518
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,840
which could help me to cover up.

519
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,760
If I didn't make it after all,

520
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,560
that's my destiny.

521
00:37:54,479 --> 00:37:55,800
Ms. Lin, you...

522
00:37:56,479 --> 00:37:57,080
Ms. Lin.

523
00:37:57,959 --> 00:37:58,719
Ms. Lin.

524
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:27,080
Jiang Cheng, appointed as
Wei Zhou's assistant commander at first.

525
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:28,399
He is persistent and brave.

526
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,800
He was introduced by Qian Ning

527
00:38:29,919 --> 00:38:31,479
and summoned by Emperor Cheng Zong.

528
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:33,639
He was being promoted and his power expanded.

529
00:38:33,919 --> 00:38:36,520
He abused his power and commanded the army.

530
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,159
Qian Ning was the second place
from the Imperial Examination.

531
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,879
His rank is the same
as secretary of the Grand Secretariat.

532
00:38:42,479 --> 00:38:44,000
He is shrewd and good at planning.

533
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,919
He is calm and reserved,
who is very much trusted by the emperor.

534
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:51,280
Li Chong, Commander of the Imperial Guards,

535
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:54,040
straightforward but grumpy.

536
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,040
He joined the late emperor in war
when he was young with a splendid record.

537
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,360
Put into an important position by the emperor.

538
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,520
He is in control of the army
and everyone finds him intimidating.

539
00:39:09,959 --> 00:39:13,239
By the grace of heaven's will,
His Majesty hereby proclaims,

540
00:39:13,278 --> 00:39:13,506
[Memorial tablet of my late father,
Lin Dao Yuan]

541
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,239
Deputy Minister of Revenue, Lin Dao Yuan,

542
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:17,360
funds deduction of 50,000 kokus.

543
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:19,560
Corruption of 10,000 Fine silver.

544
00:39:19,919 --> 00:39:23,439
To be flogged 80 times.
Confiscation of all properties.

545
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,000
Banishment of the entire family.

546
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,320
Let this be known

547
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:28,479
to the world.

548
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:46,679
Mother.

549
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,320
Mother.

550
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,360
Mother.

551
00:40:03,399 --> 00:40:04,399
Shao Chun,

552
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,840
your father is no longer here.

553
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,520
I can't live with that.

554
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:15,399
I owe you this.

555
00:40:15,919 --> 00:40:17,040
No.

556
00:40:17,399 --> 00:40:19,399
No. No.

557
00:40:20,399 --> 00:40:21,239
No.

558
00:40:21,399 --> 00:40:22,120
Madam.

559
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,399
- Mother.
- Madam.

560
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:24,760
Mother.

561
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:29,080
Mother.

562
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:35,120
Your father was an honest
and upright officer in his entire life.

563
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:38,159
He has never been corrupting.

564
00:40:39,399 --> 00:40:41,080
Why is this...

565
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:43,919
Mother.

566
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:48,040
I know that father is innocent.

567
00:40:54,399 --> 00:40:56,080
It's a shame that you are a girl.

568
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,639
If you were a boy,

569
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,280
you would be able
to ask for justice for your father.

570
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,320
I'd be able to ask for justice for my father.

571
00:41:09,399 --> 00:41:10,239
It's difficult.

572
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:13,879
It's difficult.

573
00:41:18,399 --> 00:41:19,399
Mother.

574
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,520
Madam.

575
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,399
Mother.

576
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,879
I will ask for justice for my father.

577
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,399
I will ask for justice for my father.

578
00:41:30,399 --> 00:41:33,000
Order to search. Please look carefully.

579
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,479
Go through with a fine-tooth comb.

580
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:35,919
Leave.

581
00:41:35,919 --> 00:41:38,040
Take all people from the Lin Residence.

582
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:39,360
See how they would behave in the future.

583
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,120
Officer,

584
00:41:40,479 --> 00:41:41,879
please spare us, let us go.

585
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:44,639
Help! I don't want to be banished.

586
00:41:44,959 --> 00:41:47,479
Are you Lin Shao Chun,
the daughter of Lin Dao Yuan?

587
00:41:47,479 --> 00:41:48,320
Take her.

588
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:51,320
Sir,

589
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,320
she is my daughter, Xiao Ya.

590
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,320
We are not from the Lin Residence,

591
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,120
we don't have the indenture.

592
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,479
Where is Lin Shao Chun?

593
00:42:12,919 --> 00:42:13,639
There she is.

594
00:42:15,479 --> 00:42:16,239
Mom.

595
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:18,600
Mom, I am not Ms. Lin.

596
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,919
Mom, I am not.

597
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:22,239
Mom.

598
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:23,000
Ms. Lin.

599
00:42:28,439 --> 00:42:32,120
There is nothing much I could do.
We have to take care of ourselves.

600
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:34,959
I can't protect you anymore.

601
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:37,639
- Mom. Mom.
- Granny.

602
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,600
Ms. Lin. Ms. Lin, please. I am begging you.

603
00:42:43,639 --> 00:42:44,479
Take her.

604
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:46,439
Ms. Lin, I am begging you.

605
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,840
Mom. Mom.

606
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,679
Mom.

607
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,280
Mom.

608
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:01,320
(My daughter,)

609
00:43:02,399 --> 00:43:04,840
(Lin Family treats us so well,)

610
00:43:05,479 --> 00:43:07,560
(it's time for us to return their favor.)

611
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,840
(At least, you would be able to live.)

612
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:15,280
(There's hope as long as you're alive.)

613
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,719
Mom.

614
00:43:18,959 --> 00:43:20,199
Mom.

615
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,360
Ms. Lin,

616
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,560
take it while it's warm.

617
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:46,320
Ms. Lin,

618
00:43:46,959 --> 00:43:49,239
even since I replaced Xiao Ya with you,

619
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:51,959
I have taken you as my daughter.

620
00:43:53,479 --> 00:43:55,360
After all these years,

621
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,159
Ms, Lin has suffered a lot

622
00:43:57,959 --> 00:43:59,439
and you have got them through.

623
00:43:59,959 --> 00:44:03,479
Now, we are just one step away,

624
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,760
we couldn't afford any mistake.

625
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,280
I know it well, granny.

626
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:14,919
Since you haven't completed the last art
of the Liu Three Arts,

627
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,840
what is your plan now?

628
00:44:45,639 --> 00:44:47,280
I have told you many times.

629
00:44:48,679 --> 00:44:50,560
You are already past the age to learn opera.

630
00:44:51,239 --> 00:44:53,560
I couldn't take you in
even though you are on your knees.
